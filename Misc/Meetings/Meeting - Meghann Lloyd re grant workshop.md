## Agenda
- Discuss experience with organizing workshops 
	- Costs 
	- People
	- Tips

## Notes
- CIHR Planning and Dissemination Grant to support this work.
- Having a really good facilitator is key. 
	- Helped think about the agenda and the activities. 
- Most useful thing is having clear goals for facilitator in terms of outcomes. 
- Very important to get the "right people in the room". 
	- Tried to be inclusive and consultive with invite list.
	- But, need to be selective so you don't have people who derail it. 
- High quality food makes all the difference in the world. 
- Costs: ~$15,000 
	- Includes a reception night before, which is extra. 
	- Flying people in and facilitator is the largest cost.
