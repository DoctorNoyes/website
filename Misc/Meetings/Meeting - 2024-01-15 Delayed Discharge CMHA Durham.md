### Notes 

#### Email I sent to Tracey
Thank you for your interest. It would be great to chat about the work we have ongoing. Regarding housing, there are two separate but related projects. First, I am working with a doctoral student, Reem Gaafar, who is interested in studying the experiences of people who experience delayed discharge and transition from hospital to housing. Reem is particularly interested in how these experiences intersect with gender and racial identity. Reem has plans to recruit participants for her study in the Spring/Summer, assuming we can get REB approval in the next few months.
  
Other related work involves an application for a CIHR Planning grant to hold a workshop this spring/summer with the objective of bringing together key stakeholders to discuss research priorities around housing-related delayed discharge for people with severe mental illness. This would then set the foundation for a larger-scoped cross-provincial CIHR grant application in Fall 2024.
