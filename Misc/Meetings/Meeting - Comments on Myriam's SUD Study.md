## Hypotheses
1. Psychiatrists may view patients with SUD as more difficult to treat and less likely to respond to treatment; this would manifest as them avoiding seeing patients with SUD. 
	- **Tested:** Small number of psychiatrists providing services to SUD
2. Patients with SUD may be less likely to access psychiatric services 
	 - **Tested:** Are there certain patients that may be less likely to access psychiatric services for sub-stance use? Is it just psychiatry or all formal services? Should we restrict this analysis to specific groups? What about comparing people with SUB vs. people with SUD and co-occurring conditions? This may also address the issue in point 4. If you look at people who only have SUD and no history of mental health care, what proportion of them see a psychiatrist? Should we also only look at the most complex? Perhaps people with a recent hospitalization or ED visit related to SUD? 
3. Psychiatrists may not be able to provide adequate treatment for SUD due to restrictions and/or insufficient training. 
4. Psychiatrists may provide SUD treatment without billing for it. 

> [!NOTE]
> - *I'm not sure that 4 is a hypothesis, but more of a limitation worth exploring.*


1. What proportion of BC residents with SUD receive outpatient treatment from psychiatrists? 
2. What are the characteristics of patients with SUD who receive outpatient treatment from psychiatrists relative to those who do not?


> [!NOTE] 
> I'm not sure that it matters what proportion receive care for SUD relative to other providers. They aren't substitutes. 

1. What are the characteristics and practice patterns of psychiatrists who provide SUD services relative to those who do not? 


> [!NOTE]
> What about comparing people without co-occuring conditions with those with co-occuring conditions sat the patient-level? 


### Comments Summary 
- Need to articulate a testable hypothesis: 
	- A small number of specialized psychiatrists will provide SUD services, and this will account for a large proportion of their practice, and a proportion of psychiatrists will provide zero SUD services. 
	- SUD will account for a small proportion of psychiatrist practice relative to other services provided. 
	- A large proportion of patients with SUD will not access outpatient psychiatric care following an acute episode given barriers in access, particularly for those who are most disadvantaged. 
	- Psychiatrists may not consistently bill for SUD services, particularly for patients with co-occurring conditions. So, the rate of follow-up for patients with co-occurring conditions following an acute episode will be smaller than those without a history of mental illness. 

1. Describe psychiatrist practice in terms of those who provide varying levels of SUD services: 0%, >0% & <50% , >=50. 
2. Describe the characteristics of patients with SUD who access care for SUD services from psychiatrists compared to those who do not.  Stratify by community diagnosis vs. inpatient diagnosis. 
3. Describe the rate and characteristics of patients who receive services from a psychiatrist following ED visit or inpatient hospitalization. This could be invariant to diagnostic code avoiding issue of whether they are not billing for it. 
- Append: stratify 2 by co-occurring and not occurring to see if results are different.
