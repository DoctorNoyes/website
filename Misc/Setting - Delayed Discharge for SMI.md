  - "[[üçá Delayed Discharge]]"
---
This study will take place in the Greater Toronto Area, the Greater Vancouver Area, and Halifax. We will focus on these urban centres as they have the highest concentration of people with SMI experiencing delayed discharge, with the aim of establishing some transferability to similar regions nationally.

- [ ] Need to decide if this is the focus, or if we should have rural component.
