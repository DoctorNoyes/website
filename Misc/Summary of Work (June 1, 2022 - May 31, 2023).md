In the period between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023 (the second year of my Research Chair at Ontario Shores), I have published **13 papers** in peer-reviewed journals and **6 abstracts** at peer-reviewed conferences. I mentored **2 trainees** to completion of their degrees, and am currently supervising an additional **6 trainees**. I received **$175,000 in research funding** as a co-applicant. Additionally, I have made contributions to Ontario Shores directly through my work on **Predictive Modelling**, **Mentorship**, and **Building Partnerships**.

### Goals for Year 2

### Specific Areas of Contribution to Ontario Shores

**Predictive Modelling:** We used electronic medical record data from Ontario Shores to improve patient intake and enhance treatment outcomes in outpatient psychotherapy services. I collaborated with Data & Analytics analysts to create a dataset and enlisted trainees to assist in analyzing the data. These trainees and their projects are summarized below: 
	- **Afsaneh Roshanghalb**, a post-doctoral fellow, received support from a Mitacs Accelerate grant to collaborate with Dr. Michael Best and Bojay Hansen on a manuscript. The manuscript analyzes patient characteristics related to treatment initiation, completion, and modality selection in the AMD clinic at Ontario Shores. Currently, the manuscript is under review at *BMC Health Services Research*.
	- **Nicholas Li**, an undergraduate research assistant, was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) funds. He led the analysis to predict the dose response to cognitive behavioural therapies offered at the AMD clinic at Ontario Shores. A manuscript has been developed in collaboration with Dr. Phil Klassen, Marsha Bryan, Bethany Holescheck, and Bojay Hansen.
	- **Margaret Jamieson**, a doctoral research assistant, received funding from CIHR to create a predictive model for improving the patient intake process in outpatient CBT services at the AMD clinic in Ontario Shores. The model was developed in collaboration with Data & Analytics and clinical teams at Ontario Shores and has been implemented as part of the patient intake process. A manuscript describing the development of this predictive model is currently being written.
	- **Julie Vizza**, a doctoral research assistant, received funding from a Mitacs Accelerate grant to conduct qualitative research on patient and provider experiences with electronic CBT services at Ontario Shores. This work is being completed in collaboration with Dr. Sanaz Riahi. Recruitment of patients and providers is ongoing. 

**Mentorship:** I directly supervised 6 trainees (listed below) whose work is directly related to Ontario Shores and population mental health. I also provided mentorship to 3 research assistants at Ontario Shores whose work is directly related to the interests of the organization. These trainees and staff were  funded via Mitacs Accelerate grants, or Tri-Council (CIHR, SSHRC) research funds.
- **Trainees** 
	- Tai Hollingbery, an MHSc student at Ontario Tech University, utilized electronic medical record data from Ontario Shores to examine prescribing patterns of antipsychotic medications for inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The objective of this research was to assist the implementation of the Bundled Care (Integrated Care) Pathway for Schizophrenia. The evaluation plan for Bundled Care included the integration of measures developed by Tai.
	- Aidan Bodner, an MSc student at the University of Toronto, conducted a policy scan of COVID-19 pandemic policies and programs aimed at supporting individuals with serious mental illness and/or housing insecurity.
	- Husayn Jessa, an MSc student from the University of Toronto, used administrative health data from Population Data British Columbia. His project assessed wait times for outpatient psychiatric care and identified individual-level factors linked to extended wait times.
	- Reem Gaafar, an MHSc graduate from Ontario Tech University, was supported by a SSHRC Partnership Engage Grant obtained in collaboration with Ontario Shores. The project aimed to conduct a scoping review of policies and programs that addressed delayed discharge from psychiatric hospitalization. Sarah Kipping was the organizational sponsor for this work.
	- Stephanie Littleford, an MHSc student at Ontario Tech University, successfully defended her thesis on the relationship between family physician-level characteristics and potentially inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications in British Columbia.
	- Afsaneh Roshanghalb, post-doctoral trainee at Ontario Tech University, completed an analysis of patient-level characteristics associated with CBT modality choice, treatment initiation, and treatment completion. Afsaneh is currently working on an evaluation of Ontario Shores policies concerning the use of restraint and seclusion. 
- **Research Assistants**
	- Julie Vizza, PhD Candidate at Ontario Tech University, is recruiting patients and providers at Ontario Shores to participate in semi-structured interviews about their experiences with electronic CBT services. 
	- Andrew Putman, MHSc student at Ontario Tech University, is using IntelliHealth Data (administrative health data) to analyze hospital-level variation in length of stay for people with an main diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
	- Nicholas Li, BSc student at McMaster University, led the analysis to predict the dose response to cognitive behavioural therapies offered at the AMD clinic at Ontario Shores.
	- Margaret Jamieson, PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, supported the development of a predictive model for improving the patient intake process in outpatient CBT services at the AMD clinic in Ontario Shores.

**Building Partnerships:** During my second year as Research Chair, I collaborated with researchers from Simon Fraser University (Dr. Lindsay Hedden), the University of Ottawa (Dr. Agnes Grudniewicz), and Dalhousie University (Dr. Ruth Lavergne). Together, we established the Health Systems Research Lab (www.healthsystemsresearch.ca), a national research laboratory focused on interdisciplinary, cross-provincial research to support health systems in Canada. Our goal is to recruit and mentor trainees interested in health services research. I also formed partnerships with the Health Data Research Network (www.hdrn.ca) at the University of British Columbia, which facilitates data collection and harmonization for cross-provincial research in population health and health services. Furthermore, I strengthened existing partnerships with researchers at the Institute for Mental Health Policy Research at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Dr. Claire de Oliveira, Dr. Juveria Zaheer, Dr. Paul Kurdyak, Dr. Jesse Young) and the Bruyere Research Institute (Dr. Sarina Isenberg). These partnerships will continue to benefit trainees and research conducted at Ontario Shores.
