  - "[[üçá Delayed Discharge]]"
---


The proposed research is the first Canadian study to explore the problem of delayed discharge from the perspectives of individuals with lived experience of this barrier.

- [ ] Is it true that it‚Äôs the first study?

This research will examine:
- The experiences of those experiencing delayed discharge related to SMI, their formal and informal care providers, and the staff working in housing settings that accommodate patients with delayed discharge.
- We will also examine the experiences of those discharged to the community after experiencing delayed discharge. We will focus on client experience in different models of community housing.
- We will also identify strategies that can be used to curb inefficiencies in the use of healthcare resources, increase opportunities for recovery, and improve quality of life.
- Need to decide if this is the focus of this study.
