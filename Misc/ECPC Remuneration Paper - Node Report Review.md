### Consumption/Income -- Payment Model -- FFS Income is unpredictable/alternative models predictable 

- Alternative models offer guaranteed income and financial security. 
	> I wanted something steady where I knew exactly how much money I was going to make every month instead of a fee-for-service MSP billing sort of drifting in here and there. You never know if it will get rejected or if you’ll get paid 2 weeks later, 2 months later, 2 years later. It’s quite inconsistent. So I felt like I wanted something that guaranteed me a certain income every single month so I knew my bills would be paid and I could save a certain amount (Reference 3)
- Fee-for-service leads to income uncertainty.

So I felt like I wanted something that guaranteed me a certain income every single month so I knew my bills would be paid and I could save a certain amount (Reference 3)
- Under FFS, it can be financially devastating to take time off. 
	> So I don’t like the uncertainty of fee-for-service jobs. The harder you work, the more you make. But if you want to take some time off or if you’re not able to work as much, it can be financially devastating with a mortgage and a line of credit.
- APP offers steady income that's not affected by events or causes beyond control of physician. 
	- No shows are not compensated under fee-for-service
		> Oh, totally. Like I mean in the summer, in August, one night… And the other thing is I work Wednesday evenings.  So I had 6 no-shows. So I think I see… I do a 3 hour clinic. So a third of my patients didn’t show up on a nice sunny evening in the summer. And I’m thinking, wow, like you know, I’m getting paid a third less of what I should be, you know, just from people not showing up (Reference 7)
- APP is more suited to people who are risk-adverse. 
	> I would say that I’m very risk adverse. Which is why I like being on an APP. And like seriously though, like I feel very, very badly for my colleagues when there’s a storm for two days and no one shows up, and then my colleagues don’t get paid, and then I get paid if I see 5 people, you know, in a snowstorm. (Reference 6)

### Consumption/Income -- Target income setting based on comparison 

- Working in other provinces to increase income.
	>  And compensation in BC is pretty bad compared to other parts of Canada. So working in other provinces allows me to continue to spend some time in BC because I really do like BC, I like being here, I grew up here.
- Other specialities are paid more. 
> I know a lot of doctors complain about the ophthalmologists for cataract surgery. I think they get paid a lot, and they can make tens of thousands of dollars in a day. Or that’s the gossip that I’ve heard about it. And that hasn’t changed for them, you know. So I don't know how they’ll change the way that GPs are billing. But it’s annoying. It’s so annoying.
- Comparison between community-based practice and focused practice. 
> So yeah, I think you have to look at what are people getting…people with family medicine training getting paid to work non sort of traditional family medicine jobs. And I think you have to match that. I think you have to match what… Not Emerg because they need extra training. But you have to match what the hospitalists are getting. Or at least come close so that it’s not such a huge financial sacrifice to do the office.
- Family physicians in other provinces make more. 
> And then I would say there would probably need to be at least a 30% increase in the overall compensation for me to consider doing family practice. And honestly, I feel like that’s probably the difference between us and a lot of other provinces anyway. Like I’m pretty sure in Alberta they’re getting paid 30 to 60% more than we are.
> 
> Compared to the average non-physician, it is a good amount of money to make. But compared to like other provinces, it’s on the low side
> 
> A source of frustration for I’m sure many physicians right now in NS is also being paid in a system where you’re felt that your work is recognized and equally valued to other provinces. So that would be a nice sentiment.  I’m early in my career, and I hope that things will change.
- Family physicians are expected to do more for less than other specialities 
> Part of it is you have to look at okay, we’re also expected to be available after hours for free. That is the college’s expectation and the government’s expectation. And we’re the only people who are expected to do it in family medicine. All the specialists get compensation for being on call. But family docs don’t. We’re just expected to do it.

### Consumption/Income -- Payment model, practice model, and/or practice setting selected based on earning potential 

- It is not the only consideration, will only work in an environment if I feel that I'm fairly compensated. 
> Yeah, it’s a factor. You know, the pay is… Like I don’t really have any financial needs or concerns, really.  But you know, if I can work somewhere that I get paid more, all things being equal, I’m more likely to go there than somewhere I get paid less
> 
> So for me I have a certain amount of money that I know I need to make to live the kind of life I want to live.  And above and beyond that amount of money, I could largely care less. And that’s why I'm prepared to work less than full-time.
- Payment model chosen based on earning potential 
	> I had considered these contracts, having reviewed them. But when I look at the fee-for-service compensation numbers of peers, I think that outweighs what the contracts are able to provide. And the contract has very well defined parameters of which the physician would need to work. Whereas fee-for-service is a bit more flexible and yet seems to provide similar if not greater compensation.
	- Working off debt was a motivation for being interested in income
	> Yes. It’s something I think of when I’m investigating a job. I’m thinking of what is a lucrative job. I have lots of debt. And it would be great to pay that down. And that attracts me to some positions, and it also pushes me along through fee-for-service. It changes the style in which I practice as well a bit.
- Overhead and other costs also a factor in selection of practice location and model, not just about payment. 
> So basically I’d still be paying the same as somebody who saw, you know, two-thirds of the same patient volume. So I was kind of subsidizing all the clinics where I worked basically with my work ethic. Yeah, so when I started doing addictions in the community, my overhead was a lot less. And then the compensation was much better than family practice.
- Focused practice chosen because of higher earning potential (lower costs, higher revenue)
>  And that’s the other thing about being a family doc, is that ER, ob, hospitalist, they pay significantly more than they do for a just family med clinic. And I think that’s why we’re losing people – because it costs a lot to run a clinic.  A lot of overhead.  It’s the most time-consuming aspect, and it’s the least paid of everything that we do.
- If two options require the same amount of effort, will choose the option that pays better (or has lower costs)
> Financial is probably one of the bigger ones.  Just, you know, what pays better.  If something pays better… If I put the same amount of hours into two things, I want to do the ones that pays better.  So that’s a big one.

### Insufficient Income: sense of not being sufficiently valued in some capacity 
- Compensation must be fair and aligned with the level of work and responsibility. 
> Like some people really hate fee-for-service, other people really like sessional. For me, I don’t mind the two as long as I feel like my work is well compensated. So for example, fee-for-service, while I’m practicing in BC, I’m not so happy with. Fee-for-service when I’m practicing in Alberta, I feel it’s fair. Like as long as I feel like the work that I’m doing is being paid fairly then I’m happy. (ref 1)
> 
> But I just feel like for the work that we do, and the amount of responsibility and the amount of liability, and the amount of training we’ve gone through, I just don’t feel like it’s enough.” (ref 4)

- Family medicine is undervalued/underpaid.
> And I really do enjoy family medicine.  But from a financial perspective, I know that that’s probably not…I didn’t make the best choice. (ref 5)

### Income does not cover unpaid work 
- Community-based family practice has higher administrative costs than focused practice. 
> Why would I go and work as a family doctor, see patients for 6 or 7 hours, have 3 hours of unpaid paperwork on either end of it, and make, you know, $600, $700 a day when I could go work as a hospitalist and make $1,500 a day?” (ref 1)
> 
> I feel like a family practice, it can be very difficult.  That you’re sort of tied to the one area. And it’s difficult to find coverage for your patients if you go away.  And there's a huge amount of like difficult, uncompensated work – filling out forms, following up on lab results, specialists, stuff like that.  Plus, it pays worse than emergency, even though the work is very similar a lot of the time.  So in that sense, I’ve kind of been pushed away from setting up like a traditional family practice. Because there’s a lot of downsides to it that don’t exist with me doing what I do. (ref 10)

 - It is unfair that family doctors are expected to do extra work for no compensation.
 > Part of it is you have to look at okay, we’re also expected to be available after hours for free. That is the college’s expectation and the government’s expectation. And we’re the only people who are expected to do it in family medicine. All the specialists get compensation for being on call. But family docs don’t. We’re just expected to do it. (ref 2)
 > 
 > You know, this person’s getting paid a thousand times more than me to give a recommendation, and then they don’t actually do it.  They just punt it back to me.  So we’re getting that a lot in family practice. (ref 13)
 
 - No compensation for being on-call or admin work leads to lower income and burnout, which impacts patients.
>  …right now you’re just sitting there and then maybe you’ll get paid $20 if somebody calls you. But you’re tied down. You know, you can’t go out of town. You can’t have a drink, whatever. And there's no compensation for that. (ref 3)
>  
>  …the financial compensation for family doctors in BC – disincentivizes me to work. It exhausts me with the number of hours of late night charting. And so it causes me to cut back the actual hours of patient contact so that I was...you know, I only had one hour in the middle of the night to be charting. So those are the biggest things that jump out at me. (ref 5)  

- Fee-for-service model does not compensate adequately for administrative work.
> I was always having to have people rebook and come back. I couldn't deal with issues that they wanted to do – all 7 things at once. I wish I could practice that way. And per hour, by the time you take in all your unpaid paperwork hours, it was a financially very difficult situation. Which is in part of why we left the city for a less busy, less expensive way of life. Because as a family doctor, we weren’t able to get ahead in the city in a fee-for-service model like that. (ref 4)
> 
> …the actual billing codes, like the actual compensation per what you’re doing I think is sometimes pretty abysmal or just not compensated at all. So today I have a patient who’s in hospital, and I’m on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week while they’re in hospital. And I get paid $50 a day. So it’s like well, is that really worth me getting up at 2 in the morning to discuss with the nurse, you know, their medication changes and stuff?  Not really. So there are some pretty big gaps in terms of the fee-for-service and how people are paid. (ref 7)
> 
> The only administrative burden is going over the in box and going over labs and imagery and tending to forms that employers or work…or patients wanting for time off.  Because we’re not really compensated other than our fee-for-service. Which in theory is supposed to include all that but it’s very low. So I don't think it fairly compensates us for that administrative burden. (ref 9)

- Other provinces have better ways of compensating physicians for administrative work or being on-call.
> It’s higher in Alberta. So for a standard visit, the pay is higher in Alberta. And the other thing I think that’s really important for a lot of us is in Alberta there’s what’s called time modifiers. So if you spend longer with the patient, so if you spend half an hour, 45 minutes, an hour, you can bill for that extra time. Where that’s not possible in BC. So in BC if the visit is one hour, it’s the same as a 5 minute visit. And in Alberta you can bill for time spent charting, doing referral letters – all of those extra things that add up and are unpaid.” (ref 8)
> 
> It’s still pretty miserable compared to other places across the country. There's lots of things that take extra time, that are known to take extra time, like an 18-month well baby visit or other more complex care, or mental health that you do more extensive counselling, there's no real good compensation for that. So you know, you take the extra time because you want to do your job right. But you don’t get paid more for the extra time you spend with people.” (ref 15)
