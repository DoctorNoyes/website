  {"id":"a.min2023","abstract":"INTRODUCTION\nThe literature cites many factors that influence a nurse's decision when choosing their workplace. However, it is unclear which attributes matter the most to newly graduated nurses. The study aimed to identify the relative importance of workplace preference attributes among newly graduated nurses.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an online survey and data were collected in June 2022. A total of 1111 newly graduated nurses in South Korea participated. The study employed best-worst scaling to quantify the relative importance of nine workplace preferences and also included questions about participants' willingness to pay for each workplace preferences. The relationships between the relative importance of the workplace attribute and the willingness to pay were determined using a quadrant analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe order according to the relative importance of workplace preferences is as follows: salary, working conditions, organizational climate, welfare program, hospital location, hospital level, hospital reputation, professional development, and the chance of promotion. The most important factor, salary, was 16.67 times more important than the least important factor, the chance of promotion, in terms of choosing workplace. In addition, working conditions and organizational climate were recognized as high economic value indicators.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNewly graduated nurses nominated better salaries, working conditions, and organizational climate as having a more important role in choosing their workplace.\n\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE\nThe findings of this study have important implications for institutions and administrators in recruiting and retaining newly graduated nurses.","author":[{"literal":"A.

  {"id":"abbey2006a","abstract":"Objectives: Undergraduate nursing students have often found clinical placements in aged care unsatisfactory and/or unsettling, dissuading them from considering aged care as an employment option on graduation. This study asked which elements of the clinical placement experience produced that outcome; and what changes could yield more positive outcomes. Design: A descriptive qualitative pilot study was carried out in late 2003. A combination of nominal groups and semi-  structured interviews was used with students and experienced nurses to identify commonalities and variations in issues nominated as important and in the views expressed on those issues. Transcripts were independently analysed by two experienced investigators. Themes identified were discussed among the researchers. Subjects: Fourteen volunteer undergraduate nursing students, all of whom had completed clinical placements in residential care and some of whom had prior experience in such facilities, participated in the nominal groups. Twelve registered nurses who had acted as clinical teachers in aged care facilities were interviewed. Results: Perceived issues included: unexamined assumptions about nursing's core skills; lack of pre-  placement orientation to the residential care environment; the appeal of and apprehension aroused by autonomous practice; and status, income and career progression considerations. Conclusions: Analysis of the sometimes ambivalent and conflicting views expressed pointed to possible changes, all within the domain of training and employing institutions, capable of bringing submerged issues to the surface for examination and resolution as part of raising student understanding of gerontology as a demanding specialty and residential care as a rewarding career.

  {"id":"abrahame.flanigan2020","abstract":"Laptop computers allow students to type lecture notes instead of relying on the traditional longhand (i.e. paper–pencil) method. The present research compared laptop and longhand note-taking methods by investigating how the quality (i.e. complete versus incomplete idea units) and quantity (i.e. total words and total idea units) of typed and handwritten notes differed when students did or did not reply to text messages during a simulated lecture. Accounting for the presence of text messaging while participants took notes situated the present study within the reality facing many students in today’s digital age. Findings indicated that a considerable proportion of the idea units captured in participants’ notes were incomplete, regardless of note-taking method or exposure to distraction during the simulated lecture. However, only the total number of complete idea units stored in student notes meaningfully predicted lecture learning. Furthermore, the presence of digital distraction was particularly disruptive to the quality and quantity of laptop users’ lecture notes relative to longhand note takers. Finally, digital distraction emerged as a more meaningful predictor of lecture learning than note-taking method. Recommendations for improving the quality of student lecture notes are discussed and avenues for future research into note-taking completeness and the interplay between digital distraction and note-taking method are proposed.","author":[{"literal":"Abraham E.

  {"id":"alsabbagh2020","abstract":"Introduction\nAcross the world, data sources to support learning in primary care (PC) lag far behind that of acute care. Having comparable data sources across jurisdictions is essential for scaling and spreading healthcare learnings.\nObjectives\nThe purpose of this work was to 1) identify and develop indicators of PC performance using administrative data and 2) examine the comparability of indicator definitions across three Canadian provinces (Nova Scotia, Ontario, British Columbia). This work is valuable for demonstrating how to arrive at comparable administrative data indicators across jurisdictions with different care patterns.\nMethods\nThe TRANSFORMATION study is a multi-province Canadian study of PC that aims to improve PC performance measurement reporting. We initially compiled a list of PC performance indicators that had been used with existing administrative data. We followed and documented an iterative process to achieve comparable indicator operationalizations across the three provinces in Canada.\nResults\nOur final list included 21 PC performance indicators pertaining to 1) technical care (n=4), 2) continuity of care (n=6), and 3) health services utilization (n=11). Establishing comparability between these PC performance indicators was possible. The main challenge was major differences in data characteristics and available resources including pre-existing algorithms used in each province to define the indicators. We present examples of these differences including the identification of patients with diabetes and of bone mineral density measurement.\nConclusion\nArriving at comparable definitions of PC performance indicators using administrative data is challenging and time-consuming, but possible — even without data pooling. Through an iterative and well-documented process, research teams and policy-makers can develop and establish comparability of PC performance indicators that can help in supporting continuous improvements in healthcare system performance. More work is necessary to standardize approaches and optimize the comparability of PC performance indicators across jurisdictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Alsabbagh","given":"Mhd Wasem"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"John"},{"family":"Glazier","given":"Richard"},{"family":"McGrail","given":"Kimberlyn"},{"family":"Blackman","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Beverley"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Burge","given":"Frederick"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Sabrina T."},{"family":"Kueper","given":"Jacqueline Kathleen"},{"family":"Hogg","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"alsabbagh2020","container-title":"International Journal of Population Data Science","DOI":"10.23889/ijpds.v5i1.1340","ISSN":"2399-4908","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,11]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2020 Jacqueline Kathleen Kueper, Mhd.

  {"id":"armour2001","abstract":"Managed care organizations use explicit financial incentives to influence physicians' use of resources. This has contributed to concerns regarding conflicts of interest for physicians and adverse effects on the quality of patient care. In light of recent publicized legislative and legal battles about this issue, we reviewed the literature and analyzed studies that examine the effect of these explicit financial incentives on the behavior of physicians. The method used to undertake the literature review followed the approach set forth in the Cochrane Collaboration handbook. Our literature review revealed a paucity of data on the effect of explicit financial incentives. Based on this limited evidence, explicit incentives that place individual physicians at financial risk appear to be effective in reducing physician resource use. However, the empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of bonus payments on physician resource use is mixed. Similarly, our review revealed mixed effects of the influence of explicit financial incentives on the quality of patient care. The effect of explicit financial incentives on physician behavior is complicated by a lack of understanding of the incentive structure by the managed care organization and the physician. The lack of a universally acceptable definition of quality renders it important that future researchers identify the term explicitly.Arch Intern Med. 2001;161:1261-1266-->","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Armour","given":"Brian S."},{"family":"Pitts","given":"M.

  {"id":"austin2009","abstract":"Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias when estimating causal treatment effects using observational data. Several propensity-score matching methods are currently employed in the medical literature: matching on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width either 0.2 or 0.6 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score; matching on the propensity score using calipers of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.1; and 5 → 1 digit matching on the propensity score. We conducted empirical investigations and Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the relative performance of these competing methods. Using a large sample of patients hospitalized with a heart attack and with exposure being receipt of a statin prescription at hospital discharge, we found that the 8 different methods produced propensity-score matched samples in which qualitatively equivalent balance in measured baseline variables was achieved between treated and untreated subjects. Seven of the 8 propensity-score matched samples resulted in qualitatively similar estimates of the reduction in mortality due to statin exposure. 5 → 1 digit matching resulted in a qualitatively different estimate of relative risk reduction compared to the other 7 methods. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that matching using calipers of width of 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score and the use of calipers of width 0.02 and 0.03 tended to have superior performance for estimating treatment effects (© 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  {"id":"bayoumi2020","abstract":"Background: Mental health disorders are associated with high morbidity and reduced life expectancy, and are largely managed in primary care. We sought to assess the equity of distribution of new alternative payment models and teams introduced under primary care reform in Ontario for patients with mental health disorders.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective observational study using population-level administrative data for insured Ontario adults (age ≥ 18 yr) to identify all primary care payments to physicians that were allocated to individual patients in 2002/03 and 2011/12. We identified patients with mental health disorders using validated algorithms, and modelled the relations between per capita primary care costs and mental health disorders over time, stratified by type of mental health or substance use disorder and type of primary care payment. In an adjusted model, we adjusted for age, sex, rurality, neighbourhood income quintile, immigrant status, comorbidity and primary care model. For comparative purposes, we also examined the distribution of primary care payments for people with diabetes mellitus.\nResults: Total per capita primary care payments increased more slowly over the study period for patients with mental health disorders (62.0%) than for the general population (88.3%). Total payments for patients with substance use disorders increased by 142.7%, largely owing to urine drug testing in opioid substitution clinics. Adjusted total payments for those with versus without mental health disorders decreased by 10% between 2002/03 and 2011/12, driven by lower alternative payments. Similar decreases, also driven by lower alternative payments, were found for all mental health disorder subgroups except substance use and for diabetes.\nInterpretation: Payment and team reforms were associated with inequitable resource allocation to people with mental health disorders. The findings suggest the need for monitoring reforms for their impact on high-needs populations and making appropriate adjustments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bayoumi","given":"Imaan"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Glazier","given":"Richard H."}],"citation-key":"bayoumi2020","container-title":"Canadian Medical Association Open Access Journal","DOI":"10.9778/cmajo.20190153","ISSN":"2291-0026","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright 2020, Joule Inc. or its licensors","page":"E455-E461","PMID":"32561592","publisher":"Canadian Medical Association Open Access Journal","section":"Research","source":"www.cmajopen.ca","title":"Primary care reform and funding equity for mental health disorders in Ontario: a retrospective observational population-based study","title-short":"Primary care reform and funding equity for mental health disorders in Ontario","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cmajopen.ca/content/8/2/E455","volume":"8"},

The conventional literature proposes notetaking increases student attention, provides students an external source of knowledge, and gives students the ability to encode learned material into a form most digestible to them.

This article reports on their views about the services they receive. Mismatch between expectations and provision, disputes with healthcare providers, dissatisfaction with the degree to which they have choice in their care, and suspicions about the intentions of health professionals demonstrate the extent to which powerlessness and social exclusion are replicated in healthcare economies. The inadequacy of hostels and their staff are also emphasised, with some recommendations for services.\n            Discussion and conclusions: There are few data on homeless people's perceptions of services for mental health problems. Homeless people have strong views about the adequacy of services to meet their needs.

  {"id":"bishop2014b","abstract":"Importance  There have been recent calls for increased access to mental health services, but access may be limited owing to psychiatrist refusal to accept insurance.  Objective  To describe recent trends in acceptance of insurance by psychiatrists compared with physicians in other specialties.  Design, Setting, and Participants  We used data from a national survey of office-based physicians in the United States to calculate rates of acceptance of private noncapitated insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid by psychiatrists vs physicians in other specialties and to compare characteristics of psychiatrists who accepted insurance and those who did not.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Our main outcome variables were physician acceptance of new patients with private noncapitated insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. Our main independent variables were physician specialty and year groupings (2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010).  Results  The percentage of psychiatrists who accepted private noncapitated insurance in 2009-2010 was significantly lower than the percentage of physicians in other specialties (55.3% [95% CI, 46.7%-63.8%] vs 88.7% [86.4%-90.7%]; P  P  P  P =.02).

The House of Commons sought to ensure First Nations children could access government services on the same terms as other children when it unanimously passed a private members motion in support of Jordan's Principle in 2007. Jordan's Principle states that when a jurisdictional dispute arises regarding public services for a First Nations child that are otherwise available to other children, the government of first contact pays for the service and addresses payment disputes later. Unfortunately, the federal government adopted a definition of Jordan's Principle that was so narrow (complex medical needs with multiple service providers) that no child ever qualified. This narrow definition has been found to be unlawful by the Federal Court of Canada and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.

Abstract Introduction Supported housing for people who are living with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) has been found to help reduce hospitalizations and use of the emergency department. What is not fully clear is if these types of supported housing arrangements also influence the use of primary health care and other specialist services. Aim/Question The aim of this study was to compare the use of health services use of individuals with SPMI, before and after transition to the new supported housing program. Method Using health care administrative databases, a pre-post cohort study was conducted examining the health system use of residents who transitioned from custodial to supported housing arrangements between 2017 and 2019. Results Individuals with SPMI used more primary health care and specialist physician services after transition to the supported housing model. Discussion The results suggest that a supported housing model may be associated with increased usage of outpatient person-centred health services in people experiencing SPMI. Implications for Practice The findings of this study suggest that supported housing arrangements for people experiencing SPMI may help in improving the personalization of health services for individual. This is important for nursing practice, as the findings of the study show that supported housing arrangements may assist in better supporting complex health care needs of individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Booth","given":"Richard G."},{"family":"Lam","given":"Melody"},{"family":"Forchuk","given":"Cheryl"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Shariff","given":"Salimah Z."}],"citation-key":"booth2023","container-title":"Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing","DOI":"10.1111/jpm.12915","ISSN":"1365-2850","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

Security and privacy, as well as other's influence on the choice of residential area and dwelling proved to be important predictors for satisfaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Brolin","given":"Rosita"},{"family":"Rask","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Syrén","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Baigi","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Brunt","given":"David Arthur"}],"citation-key":"brolin2015","container-title":"Issues in Mental Health Nursing","DOI":"10.3109/01612840.2014.930216","ISSN":"0161-2840","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,2]]},"page":"21-28","PMID":"25397858","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Satisfaction with Housing and Housing Support for People with Psychiatric Disabilities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3109/01612840.2014.930216","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"brushett2007","abstract":"In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Canadian cities dealt with a growing housing shortage while the federal and provincial governments argued over who would implement the provisions of the 1944 National Housing Act. This was particularly true in Toronto. As Torontonians celebrated the construction of Regent Park, Canada's “Premier Slum Clearance and Public Housing Project,” nearly 1,350 Toronto families were housed in dilapidated old army barracks and staff houses. Until Regent Park, the shelters were Toronto's only rent-geared-to-income housing project. This article challenges the assumptions that Toronto's homeless were “shiftless welfare bums” and examines the strategies shelter residents used to survive the often brutal conditions in which they lived and how they hoped to escape them. Finally, it argues that the inability of municipalities to replace emergency shelters with decent affordable housing reveals the long-standing reluctance of Canadian governments to develop social-housing programs to eliminate homelessness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Brushett","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"brushett2007","container-title":"Journal of Urban History","container-title-short":"Journal of Urban History","DOI":"10.1177/0096144206297148","ISSN":"0096-1442, 1552-6771","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3]]},"language":"en","page":"375-399","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Where will the People Go: Toronto's Emergency Housing Program and the Limits of Canadian Social Housing Policy, 1944-1957","title-short":"Where will the People Go","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0096144206297148","volume":"33"},

Far less attention has been focused on understanding the cognitive processes that underlie note-taking and how the beneﬁts of note-taking vary with individual differences in the ability to carry out these processes. One cognitive ability that has been hypothesized to be important for note-taking is working memory: the ability to temporarily store and manipulate limited amounts of information. The current paper addresses why working memory is important for lecture note-taking and reviews studies that have examined the relationship between individual differences in working memory abilities and individual differences in note-taking. There is currently a lack of consensus regarding the nature of this relationship, and this review addresses possible reasons for what may appear to be inconsistent results, including differences in how working memory and its role in note-taking have been assessed, note-taking modality, and individual differences in note-taking strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bui","given":"Dung C."},{"family":"Myerson","given":"Joel"}],"citation-key":"bui2014b","container-title":"Learning and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Learning and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.lindif.2014.05.002","ISSN":"10416080","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"language":"en","page":"12-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The role of working memory abilities in lecture note-taking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1041608014000958","volume":"33"},

We focus on the case of medical laboratory utilization and examine how physicians' laboratory test ordering patterns change following a switch to a blended capitation payment model from one with fee for service enhanced with pay for performance. Also, within blended capitation, we examine differences between traditional staffing and interdisciplinary teams. Using a propensity score weighted fixed-effects specification to address selection, it is estimated that the switch to capitation leads to a short-run average of 3% fewer laboratory requisitions per patient. Patients' laboratory utilization also becomes more concentrated with the rostering physician. More importantly, using diabetes-related laboratory tests as a case study, after joining the blended model, physicians order 3% fewer inappropriate/redundant tests, and the addition of an interdisciplinary care team makes the reduction about 9%.

  {"id":"chan2003","abstract":"Background: There have been few studies on the impact of de-institutionalization on psychiatric patients' lives in Chinese culture. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to compare quality of life (QOL) of Chinese patients with schizophrenia living in three different treatment settings (hospital, long-stay care home and half-way house) in Hong Kong, and (2) to identify factors associated with patients' subjective well-being. Method: A matched-group design was used. Subjects (n = 204) living in the three treatment settings were matched according to age, sex, educational level, marital status, length of psychiatric illness and number of previous psychiatric admissions. Multiple measures for the evaluation of QOL included the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), WHO Quality of Life Measure-Abbreviated version-Hong Kong (WHOQOL-BREF-HK), Life Event List (LEL) and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: Significant differences in objective QOL indices (global level of functioning, number of life events and income) between subjects staying in hospital and community-based residential services were found in favour of the less restrictive community settings. However, with respect to global life satisfaction, subjects preferred the more secure settings despite their restrictiveness. Predictors of subjective well-being were educational level, negative life events and the BPRS items of somatic concern, anxiety and guilt feelings. The impact of negative life events on subjective well-being decreased over time. Conclusion: In a cohort of Chinese patients with chronic schizophrenia, community-based treatment settings had a positive impact on objective QOL indices but not on subjective well-being. Negative life events, education level, and the BPRS items of somatic concern, anxiety and guilt feelings were predictors of subjective well-being which seemed to adapt to external circumstances over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chan","given":"Grace W.

  {"id":"chekroud2021a","abstract":"For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real‐world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to‐date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Chekroud","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Bondar","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Delgadillo","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Doherty","given":"Gavin"},{"family":"Wasil","given":"Akash"},{"family":"Fokkema","given":"Marjolein"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Belgrave","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"DeRubeis","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Iniesta","given":"Raquel"},{"family":"Dwyer","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Karmel"}],"citation-key":"chekroud2021a","container-title":"World Psychiatry","container-title-short":"World Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1002/wps.20882","ISSN":"1723-8617, 2051-5545","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","page":"154-170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The promise of machine learning in predicting treatment outcomes in psychiatry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20882","volume":"20"},

In response, this study examined the association between patient characteristics, LOS, and functional improvement using Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS) data from 2005 to 2015.\nMethods: The associations of patient characteristics (including key demographics, psychosocial variables, reasons for admission, and service use history) and 2 outcome measures (LOS and Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF]) were analysed with generalised linear mixed modelling (GLMM). From 2005 to 2015, a total of 48,498 episodes for distinct patients from 18 psychiatric hospitals and 57 general hospitals in Ontario were included.\nResults: For psychiatric and general hospitals, mean LOS was 96.6 and 20.5 days, and mean GAF improvement was 14.8 and 16.1, respectively. The majority of associations probed demonstrated a high degree of significance with similar patterns across general and tertiary facility contexts. Older age and more recent readmission following a psychiatric discharge were associated with longer LOS and less GAF improvement. Recent experience of adverse life events and substance misuse were associated with shorter LOS.\nConclusions: While the findings of this exploratory cross-sectional analysis will require further inquiry with respect to validity and reliability, they suggest that a different service pathway is likely required for individuals with greater psychosocial challenge and extensive service use histories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Collins","given":"April"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"Kwame"},{"family":"Kidd","given":"Sean"}],"citation-key":"chen2017a","container-title":"The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Can J Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1177/0706743716680167","ISSN":"0706-7437","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"854-863","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Patient Characteristics, Length of Stay, and Functional Improvement for Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: A Population Study of Inpatient Care in Ontario 2005 to 2015","title-short":"Patient Characteristics, Length of Stay, and Functional Improvement for Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743716680167","volume":"62"},
  {"id":"cheng2022a","abstract":"Background\nThe length of stay (LOS) of patients with schizophrenia has been a wide concern of researchers. Reasonable management of the LOS to achieve a balance between quality of treatment and efficient medical source allocation has become a significant issue in clinical work in psychiatry. Figuring out the factors related to the LOS of schizophrenia patients can help optimize its management by the hospital.\n\nMethod\nThe essential information of patients was obtained from the electronic medical record system. The variables were divided into the following kinds: demographic, clinical, and biochemical. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were conducted to find the potential factors related to the LOS of schizophrenia patients. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of judging the LOS of the regression model.\n\nResult\nA total of 1,160 patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in our research. Our results demonstrated that the status of unmarried (single, separated, divorced, or widowed) and the abnormality of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were risk factors for the longer LOS of schizophrenia patients. The area under the curve was 0.576, which meant that the regression model had a certain predictive value.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this research is the first study to analyze the effect of various factors, including the biochemical index, on the LOS of a single type of mental disorder. Marital status and TSH were proven to be related to the LOS of schizophrenia patients. The results of this study provided reference factors of LOS for clinical psychiatry, which will be helpful to the management of hospitalization and in optimizing the allocation of medical sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lirong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Lizhi"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weihui"}],"citation-key":"cheng2022a","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2021.818254","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"page":"818254","PMCID":"PMC8818940","PMID":"35140640","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Factors Related to the Length of Stay for Patients With Schizophrenia: A Retrospective Study","title-short":"Factors Related to the Length of Stay for Patients With Schizophrenia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8818940/","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"chiu2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Mental illness is widely perceived to be more of a public health concern now than in the past; however, it is unclear whether this perception is due to an increase in the prevalence of mental illness, an increase in help-seeking behaviours or both. We examined temporal trends in use of mental health services as well as objectively measured and perceived mental health.\nMETHODS: We conducted a repeat cross-sectional study of Ontario residents who participated in Statistics Canada’s Canadian Community Health Survey (2002–2014). We assessed temporal trends in objectively measured past-year major depressive episode (based on criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) and past-month psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale–6 score ≥ 8) and perceived, self-rated mental health. We also examined use of mental health services, including service use among those with a need for mental health care.\nRESULTS: A total of 260 090 survey participants were included. The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of a major depressive episode (4.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2%–5.3% in 2002 v. 4.9%, 95% CI 4.2%–5.7% in 2012; p = 0.9) and psychological distress (7.0%, 95% CI 6.3%–7.6% in 2002 v. 6.5%, 95% CI 5.7%–7.5% in 2012; p = 0.4) did not change significantly over time. However, self-rated fair or poor mental health status increased from 4.9% in 2003–2005 to 6.5% in 2011–2014 (ptrend < 0.001), as did the use of mental health services (7.2% to 12.8%, ptrend < 0.001). The percentage of individuals who had subjective or objectively measured mental health problems and did not access mental health services decreased significantly over time.\nINTERPRETATION: Given the stable prevalence of objectively measured psychiatric symptoms, the increase in use of mental health services appears to be, at least partly, explained by an increase in perceived poor mental health and help-seeking behaviours.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Chiu","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Amartey","given":"Abigail"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuesong"},{"family":"Vigod","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Kurdyak","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"chiu2020","container-title":"CMAJ","DOI":"10.1503/cmaj.190603","ISSN":"0820-3946, 1488-2329","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,30]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 Joule Inc. or its licensors","page":"E329-E337","PMID":"32392484","publisher":"CMAJ","section":"Research: Mental Health","source":"www.cmaj.ca","title":"Trends in objectively measured and perceived mental health and use of mental health services: a population-based study in Ontario, 2002–2014","title-short":"Trends in objectively measured and perceived mental health and use of mental health services","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/13/E329","volume":"192"},

We analysed a nationwide population-based reimbursement claims data set consisting of 496,338 claims for 58,287 patients with schizophrenia between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2006. A two-level random effects logistic regression model was used to identify those factors.Results:Age (<20 years (ref), 60?69 (OR 2.000, 95% CI: 1.640?2.438), ≥ 70 (2.068, 1.682?2.543)), male gender (1.192, 1.144?1.242), type of national health insurance plan (national health insurance (ref), Medical Care Aid Type 1 (4.299, 4.024?4.593)), secondary diagnosis (none (ref), psychiatric diagnosis (0.719, 0.666?0.777), non-psychiatric diagnosis (0.918, 0.850?0.991)) and type of institution (clinic (ref), psychiatric hospital (2.769, 1.507?5.087)) were associated with likelihood of long-stay status.

  {"id":"coldwell2007","abstract":"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of assertive community treatment in the rehabilitation of homeless persons with severe mental illness using a meta-analysis. Method: A structured literature search identified studies for review. Inclusion criteria were the use of an assertive community treatment-based rehabilitation treatment in an experimental or quasi-experimental model, exclusive treatment of homeless subjects, and follow-up of housing and psychiatric outcomes. Two reviewers independently abstracted data on methodology and outcomes from included studies. The authors calculated effect differences, summary effects and confidence intervals (CIs) for housing, and hospitalization and symptom severity outcomes. Results: Of the 52 abstracts identified, 10 (19%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, six were randomized controlled trials, and four were observational studies, totaling 5,775 subjects. In randomized trials, assertive community treatment subjects demonstrated a 37% (95% CI=18%–55%) greater reduction in homelessness and a 26% (95% CI=7%–44%) greater improvement in psychiatric symptom severity compared with standard case management treatments. Hospitalization outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. In observational studies, assertive community treatment subjects experienced a 104% (95% CI=67%–141%) further reduction in homelessness and a 62% (95% CI=0%–124%) further reduction in symptom severity compared with pretreatment comparison subjects.

Using Florida data on all such patients from 1992 to 2014, we decompose practice style into two components: The provider's probability of conducting invasive procedures on the average patient (which we characterize as aggressiveness), and the responsiveness of the choice of procedure to the patient's characteristics. We show that within hospitals and years, patients with more aggressive providers have consistently higher costs and better outcomes. Since all patients benefit from higher utilization of invasive procedures, targeting procedure use to the most appropriate patients benefits these patients at the expense of the less appropriate patients.

  {"id":"dalton2009","abstract":"Housing policy has declined in importance relative to other areas of state policy-making in many Western countries. This paper seeks to understand why this has happened at a time when there has been a decline in the level of housing affordability and supply of affordable rental housing. It presents an argument that a way of understanding this policy retrenchment, through a comparative analysis of Australian and Canadian housing systems, is to consider the way in which housing policy problems are defined, how policy-making capacity is institutionalised in state agencies and the form and extent of civil society mobilisation on housing issues. It is not sufficient to ascribe the declining salience of housing policy to the ascendancy of neo-liberal ideas in policy-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Dalton","given":"Tony"}],"citation-key":"dalton2009","container-title":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0042098008098637","ISSN":"0042-0980","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"63-91","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Housing Policy Retrenchment: Australia and Canada Compared","title-short":"Housing Policy Retrenchment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098008098637","volume":"46"},

Reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) on depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: PHQ-9) or anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder-7: GAD-7) outcome measures after treatment was the primary outcome. Change scores ≥6 on PHQ-9 and ≥5 on GAD-7 were taken as indicative of reliable improvement (RI). The model assumed that RI in the earliest treatment sessions would be predictive of RCSI post-treatment. Predictive accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC), as well as positive and negative predictive values. Diagnostic odds ratios were also estimated, adjusting for confounders such as baseline severity, use of medication, and pre-treatment symptom change.\n\nResults\nThe AUC estimates for session-to-session change scores ranged between .62 and .88, indicative of modest to high predictive reliability. Predictive accuracy was higher for patients who had four or more treatment sessions, with more than 70% of patients with RCSI being accurately identified as early as sessions 1–3. Attrition rates were significantly associated with poor outcomes. Results suggest that at least four therapy sessions are necessary to achieve more than 50% RCSI rates, and the dose–response effect appears to decline in treatments longer than six sessions.\n\nConclusions\nPatients showing RI early in treatment were at least twice as likely to fully recover compared to those without early RI.\n\nPractitioner points\n\n    Patients showing early response to low intensity therapy are at least twice as likely to recover at the end of treatment.\n    Dropout from treatment is associated with poor clinical outcomes.\n    Optimal recovery rates were observed for treatments with a total length of between four and six sessions; the dose–response declined in lengthier treatments.\n    Randomization to different treatment lengths is necessary to confirm this dose–response effect with greater certainty.","author":[{"family":"Delgadillo","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"McMillan","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Lucock","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Leach","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Shehzad"},{"family":"Gilbody","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"delgadillo2014","container-title":"British Journal of Clinical Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/bjc.12031","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 1999565645","page":"114-130","PMID":"24117962","title":"Early changes, attrition, and dose-response in low intensity psychological interventions.","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},

This may reflect methodological inconsistencies across studies or true differences of predictors. In this study we assessed predictors of LoS in five European countries and explored whether their effect varies across countries.\nMethods\nProspective cohort study. All patients admitted over 14 months to 57 psychiatric inpatient units in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland and United Kingdom were screened. Putative predictors were collected from medical records and in face-to-face interviews and tested for their association with LoS.\nResults\nAverage LoS varied from 17.9days in Italy to 55.1days in Belgium. In the overall sample being homeless, receiving benefits, social isolation, diagnosis of psychosis, greater symptom severity, substance use, history of previous admission and being involuntarily admitted predicted longer LoS. Several predictors showed significant interaction effects with countries in predicting LoS. One variable, homelessness, predicted a different LoS even in opposite directions, whilst for other predictors the direction of the association was the same, but the strength of the association with LoS varied across countries.\nConclusions\nThe same patient characteristics have a different impact on LoS in different contexts. Thus, although some predictor variables related to clinical severity and social dysfunction appear of generalisable relevance, national studies on LoS are required to understand the complex influence of different patient characteristics on clinical practice in the given contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Dimitri","given":"Giorgia"},{"family":"Giacco","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Victoria Jane"},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Lasalvia","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Lorant","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Moskalewicz","given":"Jacek"},{"family":"Nicaise","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Pfennig","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Ruggeri","given":"Mirella"},{"family":"Welbel","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Priebe","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"dimitri2018","container-title":"European Psychiatry","container-title-short":"European Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.11.001","ISSN":"0924-9338","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"page":"6-12","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Predictors of length of stay in psychiatric inpatient units: Does their effect vary across countries?","title-short":"Predictors of length of stay in psychiatric inpatient units","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933817330043","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"doessel2007","abstract":"Australia has a national, compulsory and universal health insurance scheme, called Medicare. In 1996 the Government changed the Medicare Benefit Schedule Book in such a way as to create different financial incentives for consumers or producers of out-of-hospital private psychiatric services, once an individual consumer had received 50 such services in a 12-month period. The Australian Government introduced a new Item (319) to cover some special cases that were affected by the policy change. At the same time, the Commonwealth introduced a 'fee-freeze' for all medical services. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, it is necessary to describe the three policy interventions (the constraints on utilization, the operation of the new Item and the general 'fee-freeze'.) The new Item policy was essentially a mechanism to 'dampen' the effect of the 'constraint' policy, and these two policy changes will be consequently analysed as a single intervention. The second objective is to evaluate the policy intervention in terms of the (stated) Australian purpose of reducing utilization of psychiatric services, and thus reducing financial outlays. Thus, it is important to separate out the different effects of the three policies that were introduced at much the same time in November 1996 and January 1997. The econometric results indicate that the composite policy change (constraining services and the new 319 Item) had a statistically significant effect. The analysis of the Medicare Benefit (in constant prices) indicates that the 'fee-freeze' policy also had a statistically significant effect. This enables separate determination of the several policy changes. In fact, the empirical results indicate that the Commonwealth Government underestimated the 'savings' that would arise from the 'constraint' policy.","author":[{"family":"Doessel","given":"Darrel Phillip"},{"literal":"Roman Scheurer"},{"family":"Scheurer","given":"Roman"},{"literal":"David Chant"},{"family":"Chant","given":"David"},{"literal":"Harvey Whiteford"},{"family":"Whiteford","given":"Harvey"}],"citation-key":"doessel2007","container-title":"Health Economics, Policy and Law","DOI":"10.1017/s1744133106006244","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2122275596","page":"7-22","PMID":"18634669","title":"Financial incentives and psychiatric services in Australia: an empirical analysis of three policy changes.","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"drake2014","abstract":"The notion of recovery has been embraced by key stakeholders across Canada and elsewhere. This has led to a proliferation of definitions, models, and research on recovery, making it vitally important to examine the data to disentangle the evidence from the rhetoric. In this paper, first we ask, what do people living with severe mental illness (SMI) say about recovery in autobiographical accounts? Second, what do they say about recovery in qualitative studies? Third, from what we have uncovered about recovery, can we learn anything from quantitative studies about proportions of people leading lives of recovery? Finally, can we identify interventions and approaches that may be consistent or inconsistent with the grounded notions of recovery unearthed in this paper? We found that people with mental illness frequently state that recovery is a journey, characterized by a growing sense of agency and autonomy, as well as greater participation in normative activities, such as employment, education, and community life. However, the evidence suggests that most people with SMI still live in a manner inconsistent with recovery; for example, their unemployment rate is over 80%, and they are disproportionately vulnerable to homelessness, stigma, and victimization. Research stemming from rehabilitation science suggests that recovery can be enhanced by various evidence-based services, such as supported employment, as well as by clinical approaches, such as shared decision making and peer support. But these are not routinely available. As such, significant systemic changes are necessary to truly create a recovery-oriented mental health system.","author":[{"family":"Drake","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Whitley","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"drake2014","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

  {"id":"falkenstrom2016a","abstract":"The Dose-Effect model holds that longer therapy leads to better outcome, although increasing treatment length will yield diminishing returns, as additional sessions lead to progressively less change in a negatively accelerating fashion. In contrast, the Good-Enough-Level (GEL) model proposes that patients, therapists, or patients-with-therapists decide on ending treatment when treatment outcome is satisfactory, meaning that patients who change faster will have shorter treatments. If true, this means that aggregating among patients with different treatment lengths would yield biased results. Most previous research has shown that symptom change rate depends on treatment length, but all of these studies used data from University counseling centers in the United States. There is a need to test if previous results hold in different settings. Two datasets from Swedish community-based primary care (n = 640) and psychiatric care (n = 284) were used. Patients made session-wise ratings on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). Multilevel models indicated better fit for a model in which treatment length moderated symptom change rate. In the primary care sample, patients in longer treatments achieved more symptom change from pre- to posttreatment, despite having slower rate of improvement. The most important aspect of the GEL model was supported, and no evidence was found for a negatively accelerating Dose-Effect curve. Results cannot be generalized beyond about 12 sessions, due to scarcity of data for longer treatments.

The objectives of this study were to identify which surgical procedures are most commonly performed in the province of Ontario and measure the extent of variation in the use of surgical procedures across Ontario counties.\n\nMethods\nWe used the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database, Same Day Surgery Database and National Ambulatory Care Reporting System to retrieve information on all inpatient and day surgery visits in Ontario between Apr. 1, 2002, and Mar. 31, 2011. We identified the 84 most common procedures according to Canadian Classification of Interventions codes. We calculated rates of use for each procedure throughout the 49 Ontario counties and then calculated measures of variation (quartile ratio and systematic component of variation) in use between the counties.\n\nResults\nColonoscopy was the most commonly performed procedure during the study period, with an average adjusted rate of 2012 per 100 000 population. The procedure with the highest measure of variation was iridectomy, with a quartile ratio of 6.7, followed by colposcopy (5.2), cervical biopsy (4.2) and femoral arteriography (4.1). These procedures were less commonly performed. Common procedures such as colonoscopy, cataract extraction and vaginal delivery had lower quartile ratios. Analysis using the systematic component of variation as the measure of variation gave similar results.\n\nInterpretation\nColonoscopy was the most commonly performed procedure in Ontario, and cataract extraction was the most common surgical procedure.

  {"id":"feinglass1991","abstract":"Several specifications of a statistical model were used to measure the effect that internal medicine attending physicians had on inpatient charges and length of stay at a large urban teaching hospital. The study was based on a sample of 1,458 patients discharged during 1985-1987 with 12 common principal diagnosis clusters. The relationship between 31 physicians' clinical decisions and hospital charges and length of stay was analyzed controlling for patients' health status, as measured by demographic characteristics, diagnostic group, and ratings for the Severity of Illness Index (SOII). Results indicated that attending physicians were statistically significant predictors of the log of total charges (p = .0030) and the log of length of stay (p less than .0001), and not as significant predictors of untransformed total charges (p = .1255). Equivalent results were obtained when overall SOII ratings were replaced by SOII subscale ratings for the presenting stage of the principal diagnosis on admission. Examination of individual physician regression coefficients revealed that physicians varied within a 40 percent range of generated per patient charges. No significant differences in mortality, early readmissions or residual impairment on discharge were found between the ten highest and ten lowest resource use physicians. The conservatively estimated range of attending physician practice variations observed in this study has serious financial implications for hospitals operating under incentives to minimize operating costs, particularly for teaching hospitals facing reductions in subsidies for graduate medical education.","author":[{"family":"Feinglass","given":"J."},{"family":"Martin","given":"G.

  {"id":"feufel2018","abstract":"Forty years of statistical database analyses have demonstrated the existence of unwarranted practice variation in care delivery, that is, variations independent of medical need, evidence, or patient preference. Alas, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and thus finding interventions to reduce unwarranted variations remains difficult, hampering quality, equity, and efficiency of care. Whereas statistical analyses describe deviations from ideal patterns, ethnographically inspired analyses aim at understanding when, how, and why variations occur in practice. Based on case studies derived from shadowing emergency physicians, I demonstrate that analyzing practice variation in practice helps to (a) advance the understanding of mechanisms and (b) evaluate/expand the existing repertoire of interventions. Results revealed unmet expectations and new sources of known variations as well as interventions complementing systemic changes with those that empower individuals to better cope with the existing system. These findings highlight the benefits of mixed-methods for understanding and tackling practice variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Feufel","given":"Markus A."}],"citation-key":"feufel2018","container-title":"Qualitative Health Research","container-title-short":"Qual Health Res","DOI":"10.1177/1049732318774322","ISSN":"1049-7323","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1486-1498","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"How to Uncover Sources of Unwarranted Practice Variation: A Case Study in Emergency Medicine","title-short":"How to Uncover Sources of Unwarranted Practice Variation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732318774322","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"finkel2021","abstract":"Objectives As part of the process of de-institutionalization in the Swedish mental healthcare system, a reform was implemented in 1995, moving the responsibility for services and social support for people with severe mental illness (SMI) from the regional level to the municipalities. In many ways, older people with SMI were neglected in this changing landscape of psychiatric care. The aim of this study is to investigate functional levels, living conditions, need of support in daily life, and how these aspects changed over time for older people with SMI. Methods In this study we used data from surveys collected in 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011 and data from national registers. A group of older adults with severe persistent mental illness (SMI-O:P) was identified and divided into those who experienced shorter stays (less than 3 years) in a mental hospital (N = 118) and longer stays (N = 117). Results After correcting for longitudinal changes with age, the longer-stay group was more likely than the shorter-stay group to experience functional difficulties and as a result, were more likely to have experienced ‘re-institutionalization’ to another care setting, as opposed to living independently. Conclusions The length of mental illness hospitalization has significant effects on the living conditions of older people with SMI and their ability to participate in social life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Finkel","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Bülow","given":"Pia H"},{"family":"Wilińska","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Jegermalm","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Torgé","given":"Cristina Joy"},{"family":"Ernsth Bravell","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Bülow","given":"Per"}],"citation-key":"finkel2021","container-title":"International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1002/gps.5515","ISSN":"1099-1166","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 The Authors.

  {"id":"finkelstein2001","abstract":"Background: Universal health care systems seek to ensure access to care on the basis of need, rather than income, but there are concerns about preferential access to cardiovascular and specialist care for high income patients. In this study, I used population-based, individual-level health, income and utilization data to determine whether whether there is evidence for differential access to physician care in relation to household income.\nMethods: I studied data for 2170 Ontario respondents to the 1995 National Population Health Survey (aged 40 to 79 years) who had approved linkage of their survey responses to the administrative databases of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and for whom income data were available. I used linear and generalized linear regression to model the mean per capita expenditures on physician care and the probability of referral to a specialist in relation to income and self-reported health status.\nResults: Residents of higher income households incurred lower per capita expenditures for physicians' services than those in lower income households; for example, the mean per capita expenditure in the upper middle income group was $220 less (95% confidence interval –$87 to –$334) than the mean per capita expenditure in the lowest income group. Expenditures were significantly related to self-reported health status; for example, the mean per capita expenditure among those reporting fair health status was $590 higher (95% confidence interval $465 to $737) than among those reporting excellent health. After adjustment for health status, there was no association between income and the expenditures on all physician services, out-of-hospital services or specialist care.\nInterpretation: Utilization of physicians' services in Ontario is based on need, rather than income.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Finkelstein","given":"Murray M."}],"citation-key":"finkelstein2001","container-title":"CMAJ","ISSN":"0820-3946, 1488-2329","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9,4]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2001","page":"565-570","PMID":"11563208","publisher":"CMAJ","section":"Research article","source":"www.cmaj.ca","title":"Do factors other than need determine utilization of physicians' services in Ontario?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/165/5/565","volume":"165"},
  {"id":"fitzpatrick-lewis2011","abstract":"Background\nResearch on interventions to positively impact health and housing status of people who are homeless has received substantially increased attention over the past 5 years. This rapid review examines recent evidence regarding interventions that have been shown to improve the health of homeless people, with particular focus on the effect of these interventions on housing status.\n\nMethods\nA total of 1,546 articles were identified by a structured search of five electronic databases, a hand search of grey literature and relevant journals, and contact with experts. Two reviewers independently screened the first 10% of titles and abstracts for relevance. Inter-rater reliability was high and as a result only one reviewer screened the remaining titles and abstracts. Articles were included if they were published between January 2004 and December 2009 and examined the effectiveness of an intervention to improve the health or healthcare utilization of people who were homeless, marginally housed, or at risk of homelessness. Two reviewers independently scored all relevant articles for quality.\n\nResults\nEighty-four relevant studies were identified; none were of strong quality while ten were rated of moderate quality. For homeless people with mental illness, provision of housing upon hospital discharge was effective in improving sustained housing. For homeless people with substance abuse issues or concurrent disorders, provision of housing was associated with decreased substance use, relapses from periods of substance abstinence, and health services utilization, and increased housing tenure. Abstinent dependent housing was more effective in supporting housing status, substance abstinence, and improved psychiatric outcomes than non-abstinence dependent housing or no housing. Provision of housing also improved health outcomes among homeless populations with HIV. Health promotion programs can decrease risk behaviours among homeless populations.\n\nConclusions\nThese studies provide important new evidence regarding interventions to improve health, housing status, and access to healthcare for homeless populations. The additional studies included in this current review provide further support for earlier evidence which found that coordinated treatment programs for homeless persons with concurrent mental illness and substance misuse issues usually result in better health and access to healthcare than usual care. This review also provides a synthesis of existing evidence regarding interventions that specifically support homeless populations with HIV.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fitzpatrick-Lewis","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Ganann","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Krishnaratne","given":"Shari"},{"family":"Ciliska","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Kouyoumdjian","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Stephen W"}],"citation-key":"fitzpatrick-lewis2011","container-title":"BMC Public Health","container-title-short":"BMC Public Health","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2458-11-638","ISSN":"1471-2458","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,10]]},"page":"638","PMCID":"PMC3171371","PMID":"21831318","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Effectiveness of interventions to improve the health and housing status of homeless people: a rapid systematic review","title-short":"Effectiveness of interventions to improve the health and housing status of homeless people","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3171371/","volume":"11"},

Practice style, which is distinguished from inducement, is modeled as a set of physician beliefs about the production function of health. In the model, per capita utilization is decomposed into a first occurences demand and an intensity demand. It is argued that the influence of practice style affects primarily the intensity with which physicians treat their patients. Alternative tests are proposed and carried out on a comprehensive aggregated measure of physician care utilization for market areas in Michigan. Although practice style is undoubtedly important for some individual procedures, the empirical results indicate that it is unimportant in determining either an aggregated index of market area utilization or the average intensity with which patients are treated by physicians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Folland","given":"Sherman"},{"family":"Stano","given":"Miron"}],"citation-key":"folland1989","container-title":"Journal of Health Economics","container-title-short":"Journal of Health Economics","DOI":"10.1016/0167-6296(89)90010-6","ISSN":"0167-6296","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",3,1]]},"page":"85-107","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Sources of small area variations in the use of medical care","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167629689900106","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"forchuk2020","abstract":"There are complex issues surrounding hospital discharge planning for people experiencing homelessness. The issue involves the disconnection across policy areas of housing, income supports and mental health, and later health generally. Different models for different types of communities (large urban, mid-size, small and rural areas) likely need to be developed as well as for different types of conditions and different housing histories. The quality of data needs improvement including accuracy. Housing items need to be part of admission processes so that the need for post-discharge housing can be quickly flagged and more accurate data can be made available. System improvements need to include all levels of government, people with lived experience, and health as well as housing/homeless sectors. The income support sector also needs to be included. Discharge planning often assumes there is a fixed address after discharge.

  {"id":"gao2015b","abstract":"Abstract   The residential aged care industry faces shortages and high turnover rates of direct care workers. This situation is further complicated by the increasing cultural diversity of residents and staff. To retain direct care workers, it is crucial to explore their perceptions of the rewards and difficulties of care work, and their employment intentions in multicultural environments. A qualitative descriptive study was used to understand perceptions of the rewards and difficulties of residential aged care work for core direct care workers (i.e. nurses and nursing assistants), how these were related to their intentions to stay or leave, and how these varied between nurses and nursing assistants, and between locally and overseas born workers. Individual interviews were conducted between June and September 2013 with 16 direct care workers in an Australian residential aged care facility with a specific focus on people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. It was found that direct care workers’ employment intentions were related to their perceptions and management of the rewards and difficulties of care work. Their experiences of care work, the employment characteristics, and the organizational resources that fitted their personality, ability, expectations, and essential needs were viewed as rewards. Evaluating their jobs as meaningful was a shared perception for direct care workers who intended to stay. Individual workers' perceptions of the rewarding aspects of care work served to counterbalance the challenges of care work, and promoted their intentions to stay. Perceptions and employment intentions varied by occupational groups and by cultural backgrounds. Overseas born direct care workers are valuable resources in residential aged care facility rather than a limitation, but they do require organizational support, such as cultural awareness of the management, English language support, a sense of family, and appropriate job responsibility. The findings indicated that aged care policy makers and service providers should understand the range of individual direct care workers’ positive and negative perceptions, and their employment intentions within the context of their roles and their cultural backgrounds.","author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Fengsong"},{"family":"Tilse","given":"Cheryl"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Tuckett","given":"Anthony G."},{"family":"Newcombe","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"gao2015b","container-title":"Journal of Aging Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaging.2015.08.006","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 1829382358\nS2ID: 22d5cf00016dcc3aea423542c87669987ee233af","page":"111-122","PMID":"26568221","title":"Perceptions and employment intentions among aged care nurses and nursing assistants from diverse cultural backgrounds: A qualitative interview study","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"gaughan2017","abstract":"Abstract\n            Delayed discharges of patients from hospital, commonly known as bed‐blocking, are a long‐standing policy concern. Delays can increase the overall cost of treatment and may worsen patient outcomes. We investigate how delayed discharges vary by hospital type (Acute, Specialist, Mental Health, Teaching) and the extent to which such differences can be explained by demography, case mix, hospital quality, the availability of long‐term care, and hospital governance as reflected in whether the hospital has Foundation Trust status, which gives greater autonomy and flexibility in staffing and pay. We use a new panel database of delays in all English NHS hospital Trusts from 2011–12 to 2013–14. Employing count data models, we find that a greater local supply of long‐term care (care‐home beds) is associated with fewer delays. Hospitals that are Foundation Trusts have fewer delayed discharges and might therefore be used as exemplars of good practice in managing delays. Mental Health Trusts have more delayed discharges than Acute Trusts, but a smaller proportion of them are attributed to the NHS, possibly indicating a relatively greater lack of adequate community care for mental health patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaughan","given":"James"},{"family":"Gravelle","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Siciliani","given":"Luigi"}],"citation-key":"gaughan2017","container-title":"Fiscal Studies","container-title-short":"Fiscal Studies","DOI":"10.1111/j.1475-5890.2017.12141","ISSN":"0143-5671, 1475-5890","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"495-519","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Delayed Discharges and Hospital Type: Evidence from the English NHS","title-short":"Delayed Discharges and Hospital Type","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2017.12141","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"gonzalez2002","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study compared baseline characteristics and clinical improvement after 12 months among homeless persons with a diagnosis of serious mental illness with and without a comorbid substance use disorder. METHODS: The study subjects were 5,432 homeless persons with mental illness who were participating in the Center for Mental Health Services' Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports (ACCESS) program. Analysis of covariance was used to compare clients who had dual diagnoses and those who did not and to identify any association between service use and clinical improvement. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 4,415 clients (81 percent). At baseline, clients with dual diagnoses were worse off than those without dual diagnoses on most clinical and social adjustment measures. Clients with dual diagnoses also had poorer outcomes at follow-up on 15 (62 percent) of 24 outcome measures. However, among clients with dual diagnoses, those who reported extensive participation in substance abuse treatment showed clinical improvement comparable to or better than that of clients without dual diagnoses. On measures of alcohol problems, clients with dual diagnoses who had a high rate of participation in self-help groups had outcomes superior to those of other clients with dual diagnoses. Clients with dual diagnoses who received high levels of professional services also had superior outcomes in terms of social support and involvement in the criminal justice system. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless persons with dual diagnoses had poorer adjustment on most baseline measures and experienced significantly less clinical improvement than those without dual diagnoses. However, those with dual diagnoses who received extensive substance abuse treatment showed improvement similar to those without at 12 months.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Gerardo"},{"family":"Rosenheck","given":"Robert A."}],"citation-key":"gonzalez2002","container-title":"Psychiatric Services","container-title-short":"PS","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.53.4.437","ISSN":"1075-2730","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4]]},"page":"437-446","publisher":"American Psychiatric Publishing","source":"ps.psychiatryonline.org (Atypon)","title":"Outcomes and Service Use Among Homeless Persons With Serious Mental Illness and Substance Abuse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.53.4.437","volume":"53"},

Methods. An OVID Medline search was done for studies in this area with terms: length of stay, acute psychiatric hospital and predictors. Indexed articles were searched for additional references and subsequently cross referenced. The variables described in various studies were classified into demographic, diagnostic, treatment related and system-based variables (Table 1). Results. Substance abuse has been consistently shown to be associated with a shorter length of stay. Mood and psychotic disorders have shown to lengthen the stay in an acute psychiatric hospital. Women tend to stay longer in an acute psychiatric hospital. Other demographic variables like age and education have had equivocal results, while a married marital status and employment are consistently related to a shorter length of stay. Use of restraints and ECT during hospitalization has shown to lengthen the stay in the hospital. Conclusions. Many studies have explored the relationship between the demographics, diagnosis and treatment variables on length of stay in an acute psychiatric hospital. These studies have been able to account for about 10–37% of the variance in the length of stay.

In virtual teams, however, establishing trust can be complicated: members may have no past on which to build, no future to reference, and may never even actually meet face-to-face. Swift but fragile trust can develop early in a team's life cycle. Yet, if swift trust doesn't develop or even dissipates, members need to find ways of building trust in each other. To this end, an understanding of how trust impacts a virtual team's development will help managers and team leaders to facilitate and improve team success. Herein, we describe the three components of trust (ability, integrity, and benevolence) and identify which of these are critical to each life cycle stage (establishing the team, inception, organizing, transition, and accomplishing the task) of the virtual team.

  {"id":"gretag.cummings2007","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite three decades of empirical investigation into research utilization and a renewed emphasis on evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice in the past decade, understanding of factors influencing research uptake in nursing remains limited. There is, however, increased awareness that organizational influences are important.OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a theoretical model of organizational influences that predict research utilization by nurses and to assess the influence of varying degrees of context, based on the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework, on research utilization and other variables.METHODS: The study sample was drawn from a census of registered nurses working in acute care hospitals in Alberta, Canada, accessed through their professional licensing body (n = 6,526 nurses; 52.8% response rate). Three variables that measured PARIHS dimensions of context (culture, leadership, and evaluation) were used to sort cases into one of four mutually exclusive data sets that reflected less positive to more positive context. Then, a theoretical model of hospital- and unit-level influences on research utilization was developed and tested, using structural equation modeling, and 300 cases were randomly selected from each of the four data sets.RESULTS: Model test results were as follows--low context: chi2= 124.5, df = 80, p <. 001; partially low: chi2= 144.2, p <. 001, df = 80; partially high: chi2= 157.3, df = 80, p <. 001; and partially low: chi2= 146.0, df = 80, p <. 001. Hospital characteristics that positively influenced research utilization by nurses were staff development, opportunity for nurse-to-nurse collaboration, and staffing and support services. Increased emotional exhaustion led to less reported research utilization and higher rates of patient and nurse adverse events.

  {"id":"gretag.cummings2007a","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite three decades of empirical investigation into research utilization and a renewed emphasis on evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice in the past decade, understanding of factors influencing research uptake in nursing remains limited. There is, however, increased awareness that organizational influences are important.OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a theoretical model of organizational influences that predict research utilization by nurses and to assess the influence of varying degrees of context, based on the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework, on research utilization and other variables.METHODS: The study sample was drawn from a census of registered nurses working in acute care hospitals in Alberta, Canada, accessed through their professional licensing body (n = 6,526 nurses; 52.8% response rate). Three variables that measured PARIHS dimensions of context (culture, leadership, and evaluation) were used to sort cases into one of four mutually exclusive data sets that reflected less positive to more positive context. Then, a theoretical model of hospital- and unit-level influences on research utilization was developed and tested, using structural equation modeling, and 300 cases were randomly selected from each of the four data sets.RESULTS: Model test results were as follows--low context: chi2= 124.5, df = 80, p <. 001; partially low: chi2= 144.2, p <. 001, df = 80; partially high: chi2= 157.3, df = 80, p <. 001; and partially low: chi2= 146.0, df = 80, p <. 001. Hospital characteristics that positively influenced research utilization by nurses were staff development, opportunity for nurse-to-nurse collaboration, and staffing and support services. Increased emotional exhaustion led to less reported research utilization and higher rates of patient and nurse adverse events. Nurses working in contexts with more positive culture, leadership, and evaluation also reported significantly more research utilization, staff development, and lower rates of patient and staff adverse events than did nurses working in less positive contexts (i.e., those that lacked positive culture, leadership, or evaluation).CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the combined importance of culture, leadership, and evaluation to increase research utilization and improve patient safety. The findings may serve to strengthen the PARIHS framework and to suggest that, although it is not fully developed, the framework is an appropriate guide to implement research into practice.","author":[{"literal":"Greta G.

  {"id":"grudniewicz2022","abstract":"Introduction People with serious mental illness (SMI) have poor health outcomes, in part because of inequitable access to quality health services. Primary care is well suited to coordinate and manage care for this population; however, providers may feel ill-equipped to do so and patients may not have the support and resources required to coordinate their care. We lack a strong understanding of prevention and management of chronic disease in primary care among people with SMI as well as the context-specific barriers that exist at the patient, provider and system levels. This mixed methods study will answer three research questions: (1) How do primary care services received by people living with SMI differ from those received by the general population? (2) What are the experiences of people with SMI in accessing and receiving chronic disease prevention and management in primary care? (3) What are the experiences of primary care providers in caring for individuals with SMI?\nMethods and analysis We will conduct a concurrent mixed methods study in Ontario and British Columbia, Canada, including quantitative analyses of linked administrative data and in-depth qualitative interviews with people living with SMI and primary care providers. By comparing across two provinces, each with varying degrees of mental health service investment and different primary care models, results will shed light on individual and system-level factors that facilitate or impede quality preventive and chronic disease care for people with SMI in the primary care setting.\nEthics and dissemination This study was approved by the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and partner institutions. An integrated knowledge translation approach brings together researchers, providers, policymakers, decision-makers, patient and caregiver partners and knowledge users. Working with this team, we will develop policy-relevant recommendations for improvements to primary care systems that will better support providers and reduce health inequities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Grudniewicz","given":"Agnes"},{"family":"Peckham","given":"Allie"},{"family":"Rudoler","given":"David"},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"M.

  {"id":"guo2020","abstract":"Propensity score analysis is often used to address selection bias in program evaluation with observational data. However, a recent study suggested that propensity score matching may accomplish the opposite of its intended goal—increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. We assess common propensity score models and offer our responses to these criticisms. We used Monte Carlo methods to simulate two alternative settings of data creation—selection on observed variables versus selection on unobserved variables—and compared eight propensity score models on bias reduction and sample-size retention. Based on the simulations, no single propensity score method reduced bias across all scenarios. Optimal results depend on the fit between assumptions embedded in the analytic model and the process of data generation. Methodologic knowledge of model assumptions and substantive knowledge of causal mechanisms, including sources of selection bias, should inform the choice of analytic strategies involving propensity scores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Shenyang"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qi"}],"citation-key":"guo2020","container-title":"Journal of the Society for Social Work and Research","DOI":"10.1086/711393","ISSN":"2334-2315","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9]]},"page":"463-482","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Propensity Score Analysis: Recent Debate and Discussion","title-short":"Propensity Score Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711393","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"gutwinski2021","abstract":"Background Homelessness continues to be a pressing public health concern in many countries, and mental disorders in homeless persons contribute to their high rates of morbidity and mortality. Many primary studies have estimated prevalence rates for mental disorders in homeless individuals. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the prevalence of any mental disorder and major psychiatric diagnoses in clearly defined homeless populations in any high-income country. Methods and findings We systematically searched for observational studies that estimated prevalence rates of mental disorders in samples of homeless individuals, using Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2007, and searched until 1 April 2021. Studies were included if they sampled exclusively homeless persons, diagnosed mental disorders by standardized criteria using validated methods, provided point or up to 12-month prevalence rates, and were conducted in high-income countries. We identified 39 publications with a total of 8,049 participants. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for prevalence studies and a risk of bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses of prevalence rates were conducted, and heterogeneity was assessed by meta-regression analyses. The mean prevalence of any current mental disorder was estimated at 76.2% (95% CI 64.0% to 86.6%). The most common diagnostic categories were alcohol use disorders, at 36.7% (95% CI 27.7% to 46.2%), and drug use disorders, at 21.7% (95% CI 13.1% to 31.7%), followed by schizophrenia spectrum disorders (12.4% [95% CI 9.5% to 15.7%]) and major depression (12.6% [95% CI 8.0% to 18.2%]). We found substantial heterogeneity in prevalence rates between studies, which was partially explained by sampling method, study location, and the sex distribution of participants. Limitations included lack of information on certain subpopulations (e.g., women and immigrants) and unmet healthcare needs. Conclusions Public health and policy interventions to improve the health of homeless persons should consider the pattern and extent of psychiatric morbidity. Our findings suggest that the burden of psychiatric morbidity in homeless persons is substantial, and should lead to regular reviews of how healthcare services assess, treat, and follow up homeless people. The high burden of substance use disorders and schizophrenia spectrum disorders need particular attention in service development.

  {"id":"haddaway2014","abstract":"Decisions in policy and practice should always be based on the best available evidence, but synthesising the evidence is often considered an insurmountable task. Reviews aim to summarise (synthesise) the evidence in a form that is readily digestible by decision makers. Systematic reviews (SRs) are emerging as an important tool and industry standard in reviewing evidence across many disciplines. SRs are transparent, repeatable and objective, reducing bias and maximising reliability. SRs are typically much less susceptible to bias than traditional reviews, many meta-analyses and other syntheses as a result of strict guidelines and highly detailed a priori methods. SR began in medicine and revolutionised medical policy and practice by pooling disparate studies and identifying common trends that may be missed by individual studies. SRs are now also used in public health and in environmental and social sciences to aid in decision making. SR in environmental management was adapted in response to a need for answers to controversial questions, questions where doubt existed about the reliability of the evidence and where the evidence base appeared to lack consensus. SR is a valuable tool for any researcher provided they assemble the right team and have the necessary support available. They can complement longer postgraduate study and involve the development of valuable transferable skills including searching, critical appraisal, quantitative and qualitative analysis, scientific writing and science communication. Along with synthesising evidence to provide answers to questions, SRs can help in formulating hypotheses, identify knowledge gaps and highlight deficiencies in methodologies used in published research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Haddaway","given":"Neal R."},{"family":"Pullin","given":"Andrew S."}],"citation-key":"haddaway2014","container-title":"Springer Science Reviews","container-title-short":"Springer Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1007/s40362-014-0023-1","ISSN":"2213-7793","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"179-183","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Policy Role of Systematic Reviews: Past, Present and Future","title-short":"The Policy Role of Systematic Reviews","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40362-014-0023-1","volume":"2"},

However, previous research has suggested that most of the variation in utilization for general medical conditions is attributable to case-mix indicators and random sources rather than individual providers. Hospital discharge data are used to estimate hierarchical linear models, where hospitals and physicians within hospitals are treated as a random effect. The goal was to determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for psychiatric LOS for hospitals and for physicians before and after making case-mix adjustments. After controlling for case-mix, the hospital ICCs for depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder show that 32%, 36%, and 11% of the variation in LOS, respectively, can be attributed to hospitals, while 7%, 5%, and 6% of the variation in LOS, respectively, can be attributed to physicians or provider practice.

  {"id":"hedden2023","abstract":"Introduction\nPrivatisation through the expansion of private payment and investor-owned corporate healthcare delivery in Canada raises potential conflicts with equity principles on which Medicare (Canadian public health insurance) is founded. Some cases of privatisation are widely recognised, while others are evolving and more hidden, and their extent differs across provinces and territories likely due in part to variability in policies governing private payment (out-of-pocket payments and private insurance) and delivery.\n\nMethods and analysis\nThis pan-Canadian knowledge mobilisation project will collect, classify, analyse and interpret data about investor-owned privatisation of healthcare financing and delivery systems in Canada. Learnings from the project will be used to develop, test and refine a new conceptual framework that will describe public-private interfaces operating within Canada’s healthcare system. In Phase I, we will conduct an environmental scan to: (1) document core policies that underpin public-private interfaces; and (2) describe new or emerging forms of investor-owned privatisation (‘cases’). We will analyse data from the scan and use inductive content analysis with a pragmatic approach. In Phase II, we will convene a virtual policy workshop with subject matter experts to refine the findings from the environmental scan and, using an adapted James Lind Alliance Delphi process, prioritise health system sectors and/or services in need of in-depth research on the impacts of private financing and investor-owned delivery.\n\nEthics and dissemination\nWe have obtained approval from the research ethics boards at Simon Fraser University, University of British Columbia and University of Victoria through Research Ethics British Columbia (H23-00612). Participants will provide written informed consent. In addition to traditional academic publications, study results will be summarised in a policy report and a series of targeted policy briefs distributed to workshop participants and decision/policymaking organisations across Canada. The prioritised list of cases will form the basis for future research projects that will investigate the impacts of investor-owned privatisation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedden","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"Spencer","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Allin","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Contandriopoulos","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Gavin","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Grudniewicz","given":"Agnes"},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"M Ruth"},{"family":"Leaver","given":"Chad"},{"family":"Lexchin","given":"Joel"},{"family":"McKay","given":"Madeleine"},{"family":"Mathews","given":"Maria"},{"family":"McCracken","given":"Rita K"},{"family":"McGrail","given":"Kimberlyn"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Karen S"},{"family":"Poitras","given":"Marie-Eve"},{"family":"Rudoler","given":"David"},{"family":"Spithoff","given":"Sheryl"},{"family":"Vanstone","given":"Meredith"}],"citation-key":"hedden2023","container-title":"BMJ Open","container-title-short":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077783","ISSN":"2044-6055","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,21]]},"page":"e077783","PMCID":"PMC10445372","PMID":"37604630","source":"PubMed Central","title":"For health or for profit?

  {"id":"hoifodt2015a","abstract":"Background: Several studies have demonstrated the effect of guided Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for depression. However, ICBT is not suitable for all depressed patients and there is a considerable level of nonresponse. Research on predictors and moderators of outcome in ICBT is inconclusive. Objective: This paper explored predictors of response to an intervention combining the Web-based program MoodGYM and face-to-face therapist guidance in a sample of primary care patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Methods: Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition or to a delayed treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the MoodGYM program, face-to-face guidance from a psychologist, and reminder emails. In this paper, data from the treatment phase of the 2 groups was merged to increase the sample size (n=82). Outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms during treatment as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Predictors included demographic variables, severity variables (eg, number of depressive episodes and pretreatment depression and anxiety severity), cognitive variables (eg, dysfunctional thinking), module completion, and treatment expectancy and motivation. Using Bayesian analysis, predictors of response were explored with a latent-class approach and by analyzing whether predictors affected the slope of response. Results: A 2-class model distinguished well between responders (74%, 61/82) and nonresponders (26%, 21/82). Our results indicate that having had more depressive episodes, being married or cohabiting, and scoring higher on a measure of life satisfaction had high odds for positively affecting the probability of response. Higher levels of dysfunctional thinking had high odds for a negative effect on the probability of responding. Prediction of the slope of response yielded largely similar results. Bayes factors indicated substantial evidence that being married or cohabiting predicted a more positive treatment response. The effects of life satisfaction and number of depressive episodes were more uncertain. There was substantial evidence that several variables were unrelated to treatment response, including gender, age, and pretreatment symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Treatment response to ICBT with face-to-face guidance may be comparable across varying levels of depressive severity and irrespective of the presence and severity of comorbid anxiety. Being married or cohabiting, reporting higher life satisfaction, and having had more depressive episodes may predict a more favorable response, whereas higher levels of dysfunctional thinking may be a predictor of poorer response. More studies exploring predictors and moderators of Internet-based treatments are needed to inform for whom this treatment is most effective.

  {"id":"innvaer2002","abstract":"Objectives: The empirical basis for theories and common wisdom regarding how to improve appropriate use of research evidence in policy decisions is unclear. One source of empirical evidence is interview studies with policy-makers. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the evidence from interview studies of facilitators of, and barriers to, the use of research evidence by health policy-makers.\nMethods: We searched multiple databases, including Medline, Embase, Sociofile, PsychLit, PAIS, IBSS, IPSA and HealthStar in June 2000, hand-searched key journals and personally contacted investigators. We included interview studies with health policy-makers that covered their perceptions of the use of research evidence in health policy decisions at a national, regional or organisational level. Two reviewers independently assessed the relevance of retrieved articles, described the methods of included studies and extracted data that were summarised in tables and analysed qualitatively.\nResults: We identified 24 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 2041 interviews with health policy-makers. Assessments of the use of evidence were largely descriptive and qualitative, focusing on hypothetical scenarios or retrospective perceptions of the use of evidence in relation to specific cases. Perceived facilitators of, and barriers to, the use of evidence varied. The most commonly reported facilitators were personal contact (13/24), timely relevance (13/24), and the inclusion of summaries with policy recommendations (11/24). The most commonly reported barriers were absence of personal contact (11/24), lack of timeliness or relevance of research (9/24), mutual mistrust (8/24) and power and budget struggles (7/24).\nConclusions: Interview studies with health policy-makers provide only limited support for commonly held beliefs about facilitators of, and barriers to, their use of evidence, and raise questions about commonsense proposals for improving the use of research for policy decisions. Two-way personal communication, the most common suggestion, may improve the appropriate use of research evidence, but it might also promote selective (inappropriate) use of research evidence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Innvær","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Vist","given":"Gunn"},{"family":"Trommald","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Oxman","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"innvaer2002","container-title":"Journal of Health Services Research & Policy","container-title-short":"J Health Serv Res Policy","DOI":"10.1258/135581902320432778","ISSN":"1355-8196","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"239-244","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Health policy-makers' perceptions of their use of evidence: a systematic review","title-short":"Health policy-makers' perceptions of their use of evidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1258/135581902320432778","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"jaakkimainen2021","abstract":"Purpose The authors developed and validated an algorithm using health administrative data to identify patients who are attached or uncertainly attached to a primary care provider (PCP) using patient responses to a survey conducted in Ontario, Canada. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a validation study using as a reference standard respondents to a community-based survey who indicated they did or did not have a PCP. The authors developed and tested health administrative algorithms against this reference standard. The authors calculated the sensitivity, specificity positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) on the final patient attachment algorithm. The authors then applied the attachment algorithm to the 2017 Ontario population. Findings The patient attachment algorithm had an excellent sensitivity (90.5%) and PPV (96.8%), though modest specificity (46.1%) and a low NPV (21.3%). This means that the algorithm assigned survey respondents as being attached to a PCP and when in fact they said they had a PCP, yet a significant proportion of those found to be uncertainly attached had indicated they did have a PCP. In 2017, most people in Ontario, Canada (85.4%) were attached to a PCP but 14.6% were uncertainly attached. Research limitations/implications Administrative data for nurse practitioner's encounters and other interprofessional care providers are not currently available. The authors also cannot separately identify primary care visits conducted in walk in clinics using our health administrative data. Finally, the definition of hospital-based healthcare use did not include outpatient specialty care. Practical implications Uncertain attachment to a primary health care provider is a recurrent problem that results in inequitable access in health services delivery. Providing annual reports on uncertainly attached patients can help evaluate primary care system changes developed to improve access. This algorithm can be used by health care planners and policy makers to examine the geographic variability and time trends of the uncertainly attached population to inform the development of programs to improve primary care access. Social implications As primary care is an essential component of a person's medical home, identifying regions or high need populations that have higher levels of uncertainly attached patients will help target programs to support their primary care access and needs. Furthermore, this approach will be useful in future research to determine the health impacts of uncertain attachment to primary care, especially in view of a growing body of the literature highlighting the importance of primary care continuity. Originality/value This patient attachment algorithm is the first to use existing health administrative data validated with responses from a patient survey. Using patient surveys alone to assess attachment levels is expensive and time consuming to complete. They can also be subject to poor response rates and recall bias. Utilizing existing health administrative data provides more accurate, timely estimates of patient attachment for everyone in the population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaakkimainen","given":"Liisa"},{"family":"Bayoumi","given":"Imaan"},{"family":"Glazier","given":"Richard H."},{"family":"Premji","given":"Kamila"},{"family":"Kiran","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Shahriar"},{"family":"Frymire","given":"Eliot"},{"family":"Green","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"jaakkimainen2021","container-title":"Journal of Health Organization and Management","DOI":"10.1108/JHOM-05-2020-0171","ISSN":"1477-7266","issue":"ahead-of-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Development and validation of an algorithm using health administrative data to define patient attachment to primary care providers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JHOM-05-2020-0171","volume":"ahead-of-print"},

Our study is the first to use large-scale national routine data to track English hospitals’ LOS for patients with a main diagnosis of SMI over time to examine the patient and local area factors influencing LOS and quantify the provider level effects to draw out the implications for payment systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Rowena"},{"family":"Gutacker","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Goddard","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Gravelle","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Kendrick","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Gilbody","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"jacobs2015b","container-title":"BMC Health Services Research","container-title-short":"BMC Health Services Research","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-015-1107-6","ISSN":"1472-6963","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,30]]},"page":"439","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Determinants of hospital length of stay for people with serious mental illness in England and implications for payment systems: a regression analysis","title-short":"Determinants of hospital length of stay for people with serious mental illness in England and implications for payment systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-015-1107-6","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"jaeger2015","abstract":"Individuals with severe mental illness frequently have difficulties in obtaining and maintaining adequate accommodation. If they are not willing or able to adapt to requirements of traditional supported housing institutions they may live in sheltered and emergency accommodation. Adequate mental health services are rarely available in these facilities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate mental health, functional and social status of individuals living in community sheltered housing facilities. A cross-sectional survey of n=338 individuals in sheltered housing compared to a sample of patients at intake in acute inpatient psychiatry (n=619) concerning clinical and social variables was carried out in the catchment area of Zurich. Matched subsamples of individuals with schizophrenia (n=168) were compared concerning functioning and impairments on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). Individuals with schizophrenia in sheltered housing (25% of the residents) have significantly more problems concerning substance use, physical illness, psychopathological symptoms other than psychosis and depression, and relationships, daily activities and occupation than patients with schizophrenia at intake on an acute psychiatric ward. Community sheltered accommodation although conceptualized to prevent homelessness in the general population de facto serve as housing facilities for individuals with schizophrenia and other severe mental illness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaeger","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Briner","given":"David"},{"family":"Kawohl","given":"Wolfram"},{"family":"Seifritz","given":"Erich"},{"family":"Baumgartner-Nietlisbach","given":"Gabriela"}],"citation-key":"jaeger2015","container-title":"Psychiatry Research","container-title-short":"Psychiatry Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.psychres.2015.09.029","ISSN":"0165-1781","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,15]]},"page":"413-418","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Psychosocial functioning of individuals with schizophrenia in community housing facilities and the psychiatric hospital in Zurich","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178115303668","volume":"230"},
  {"id":"jamet2020","abstract":"Abstract   University students often engage in multimedia (e.g., texting or social networks) and nonmultimedia (e.g., chatting with neighbors) off-task multitasking behaviors during courses. The aim of the present study was to describe these off-task multitasking behaviors and analyze their effects on learning performance in a real teaching session. More specifically, 187 students attended a cognitive psychology tutorial as usual, taking notes either on paper or on a laptop. In an effort to preserve the ecological setting, they were not informed of our research on multitasking. After 20 minutes, students had to report the number and duration of off-task multitasking behaviors they had engaged in and complete a learning questionnaire. Results showed that multimedia and nonmultimedia multitasking behaviors were frequent but also additive, especially among students who used a laptop. These behaviors had a negative impact on students’ memorization of course content, although we found no significant effects on comprehension. Our study also showed that students who used a laptop had lower memory scores. A mediation analysis confirmed that this deleterious effect was partly attributable to multitasking. These results are discussed in terms of interference between off-task behaviors and the cognitive processes essential for learning.","author":[{"family":"Jamet","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Gonthier","given":"Corentin"},{"literal":"Salomeacute Cojean"},{"family":"Cojean","given":"Salomé"},{"family":"Colliot","given":"Tiphaine"},{"family":"Erhel","given":"Séverine"}],"citation-key":"jamet2020","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2020.106264","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2999565653","page":"106264","title":"Does multitasking in the classroom affect learning outcomes?

  {"id":"kabir2022a","abstract":"Background Focused practice within family medicine may be increasing globally, but there is limited research on the factors contributing to decisions to focus practice.\nAim To examine the factors influencing resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice across three Canadian provinces.\nDesign and setting A subset of qualitative interview data were analysed from a study across British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, Canada.\nMethod Included in the analysis were a total of 22 resident family physicians and 38 early-career family physicians in their first 10 years of practice who intend to or currently practise in a focused area. Comparisons were made for participant types, provinces, and the degree of focused practice, while identifying themes related to factors influencing the pursuit of focused practice.\nResults Three key themes were identified of factors contributing to choices of focused practice: self-preservation within the current structure of the healthcare system; support from colleagues; and training experiences in medical school and/or residency. Minor themes included: alignment of practice with skills, personal values, or ability to derive professional satisfaction; personal lived experiences; and having many attractive opportunities for focused practice.\nConclusion Both groups of participants unanimously viewed focused practice as a way to circumvent the burnout or exhaustion they associated with comprehensive practice in the current structure of the healthcare system. This finding, in addition to other influential factors, was consistent across the three provinces.

  {"id":"kahneman1979","abstract":"This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahneman","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tversky","given":"Amos"}],"citation-key":"kahneman1979","container-title":"Econometrica","DOI":"10.2307/1914185","ISSN":"0012-9682","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"page":"263-291","publisher":"[Wiley, Econometric Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk","title-short":"Prospect Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"kapadia2023","abstract":"This article critically reviews previous research in the field of stigma, mental illness and ‘race’ and ethnicity, and argues for a shift of focus from individual and community blame, as inferred by mental illness stigma, to a more comprehensive view of how stigma operates against a backdrop of structural and institutional racism. Ethnic minority people have poorer mental health outcomes compared with White majority populations. Dominant narratives of greater mental illness stigma in ethnic minority populations, due to religious, spiritual or traditional beliefs and leading to a lower use of services, have taken centre stage in the explanations for these consequent poorer outcomes. This article argues that this ‘fact’ has become taken for granted as knowledge without corresponding comparative research evidence. Research in the field has also failed to robustly consider how racism might operate in conjunction with different forms of mental illness stigma (particularly structural stigma) to exacerbate mental illness and influence pathways to mental health treatment. Future research should centre the role of racism and structural stigma in explaining the poorer mental health outcomes for ethnic minority people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kapadia","given":"Dharmi"}],"citation-key":"kapadia2023","container-title":"Sociology of Health & Illness","container-title-short":"Sociology Health &amp; Illness","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9566.13615","ISSN":"0141-9889, 1467-9566","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"855-871","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Stigma, mental illness & ethnicity: Time to centre racism and structural stigma","title-short":"Stigma, mental illness & ethnicity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.13615","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"kates2017","abstract":"For 20 years mental health and primary care providers across Canada have been working collaboratively together to improve access to care, provider skills, and patient experience. The new strategic plan of the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) offers many opportunities for collaborative care to play a role in the transformation of Canada’s mental health systems. To assist the plan, this paper presents principles underlying successful projects and ways that mental health and primary care services can work together more collaboratively, including integrating mental health providers in primary care. It integrates these concepts into a Canadian Model for Collaborative Mental Health Care that can guide future expansion of these approaches, and suggests ways in which better collaboration can address wider issues facing all of Canada’s health care systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kates","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"kates2017","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Community Mental Health","container-title-short":"Canadian Journal of Community Mental Health","DOI":"10.7870/cjcmh-2017-033","ISSN":"0713-3936","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"33-67","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mental Health and Primary Care: Contributing to Mental Health System Transformation in Canada","title-short":"Mental Health and Primary Care","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://cjcmh.com/doi/10.7870/cjcmh-2017-033","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"killaspy2016","abstract":"Background\nNo standardised tools for assessing the quality of specialist mental health supported accommodation services exist. To address this, we adapted the Quality Indicator for Rehabilitative care-QuIRC-that was originally developed to assess the quality of longer term inpatient and community based mental health facilities. The QuIRC, which is completed by the service manager and gives ratings of seven domains of care, has good psychometric properties.\n\nMethods\nFocus groups with staff of the three main types of supported accommodation in the UK (residential care, supported housing and floating outreach services) were carried out to identify potential amendments to the QuIRC. Additional advice was gained from consultation with three expert panels, two of which comprised service users with lived experience of mental health and supported accommodation services. The amended QuIRC (QuIRC-SA) was piloted with a manager of each of the three service types. Item response variance, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were assessed in a random sample of 52 services. Factorial structure and discriminant validity were assessed in a larger random sample of 87 services.\n\nResults\nThe QuIRC-SA comprised 143 items of which only 18 items showed a narrow range of response and five items had poor inter-rater reliability. The tool showed good discriminant validity, with supported housing services generally scoring higher than the other two types of supported accommodation on most domains. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the QuIRC-SA items loaded onto the domains to which they had been allocated.\n\nConclusions\nThe QuIRC-SA is the first standardised tool for quality assessment of specialist mental health supported accommodation services. Its psychometric properties mean that it has potential for use in research as well as audit and quality improvement programmes. A web based application is being developed to make it more accessible which will produce a printable report for the service manager about the performance of their service, comparison data for similar services and suggestions on how to improve service quality.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12888-016-0799-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Killaspy","given":"Helen"},{"family":"White","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Dowling","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Krotofil","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Sandhu","given":"Sima"},{"family":"Arbuthnott","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Curtis","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Leavey","given":"Gerard"},{"family":"Priebe","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Geoff"},{"family":"King","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"killaspy2016","container-title":"BMC Psychiatry","container-title-short":"BMC Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-016-0799-4","ISSN":"1471-244X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,14]]},"page":"101","PMCID":"PMC4831104","PMID":"27075574","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Adaptation of the Quality Indicator for Rehabilitative Care (QuIRC) for use in mental health supported accommodation services (QuIRC-SA)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4831104/","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"kim2018a","abstract":"This paper addresses the eﬀects of access to slide copies during lectures using PowerPoint® for undergraduate students on their learning outcomes depending on the quantity of notes they take and immediate vs. delayed testing. Seventy-one students repeatedly participated in the following six lecture conditions: accessibility to slides (full, partial, and no slide copy) × memory term (immediate and delayed test). Thus, the present study adopted a 3 × 2 within-subjects design with two note-taking covariates (the quantity of words and markers in notes). A mixed-eﬀects model and counterbalancing method were applied to control idiosyncrasies and order eﬀects caused by repeated measurement. The results revealed that accessibility to slide copies and students' note-taking predicted their learning outcomes. The eﬀects of no slide copy were signiﬁcant in both short- and long-term memory conditions as compared to those of access to full and partial copies. Access to full and partial slide copies did not have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results. However, according to the interaction results between accessibility and memory term, the long-term encoding eﬀect was assumed for the partial slide copy condition. Regarding notetaking variables, students’ performance was considerably impacted by the number of markers but none of the number of words. The ﬁndings suggest educational implications for the way slides are prepared and provided and the way students take notes during slide-based lectures from a perspective of writing-to-learn.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyeyoun"}],"citation-key":"kim2018a","container-title":"Computers & Education","container-title-short":"Computers & Education","DOI":"10.1016/j.compedu.2018.04.004","ISSN":"03601315","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"language":"en","page":"13-25","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impact of slide-based lectures on undergraduate students’ learning: Mixed effects of accessibility to slides, differences in note-taking, and memory term","title-short":"Impact of slide-based lectures on undergraduate students’ learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360131518300848","volume":"123"},
  {"id":"king2019","abstract":"We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal—thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"king2019","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1017/pan.2019.11","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","page":"435-454","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Why Propensity Scores Should Not Be Used for Matching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/why-propensity-scores-should-not-be-used-for-matching/94DDE7ED8E2A796B693096EB714BE68B","volume":"27"},

This meta-analysis of 57 note-taking versus no note-taking comparison studies explored what limits the encoding eVect by examining the moderating inXuence of seven variables: intervention, schooling level, presentation mode and length, test mode, and publication year and source. It was found that (a) either positive interventions or rise in schooling level did not enhance the beneWts of note-taking; (b) visual presentation of learning material interfered with the note-taking process, whereas longer presentation did not; (c) recall test detected the encoding eVect more than recognition and higher-order performance tests; and (d) publication year and source contributed to the variation in eVect sizes. These results suggest that the modest encoding eVect is not due to the incompleteness of students’ spontaneous note-taking procedures, but mechanical demands of note-taking, type of learning outcome measure, and publication characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Keiichi"}],"citation-key":"kobayashi2005b","container-title":"Contemporary Educational Psychology","container-title-short":"Contemporary Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cedpsych.2004.10.001","ISSN":"0361476X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",4]]},"language":"en","page":"242-262","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What limits the encoding effect of note-taking?

  {"id":"koo2016","abstract":"Objective\nIntraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis.\n\nDiscussion for Researchers\nThere are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections.\n\nDiscussion for Readers\nWhen coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.\n\nConclusion\nThis article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications.

  {"id":"kroenke2001","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nWhile considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.\n\nRESULTS\nAs PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kroenke","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Spitzer","given":"Robert L"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Janet B W"}],"citation-key":"kroenke2001","container-title":"Journal of General Internal Medicine","container-title-short":"J Gen Intern Med","DOI":"10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x","ISSN":"0884-8734","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9]]},"page":"606-613","PMCID":"PMC1495268","PMID":"11556941","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The PHQ-9","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495268/","volume":"16"},

We measured the characteristics of psychiatrists' patient panels, including sociodemographic characteristics, outpatient panel size, number of new patients, inpatient and outpatient visits per psychiatrist, and percentages of psychiatrists seeing fewer than 40 and fewer than 100 unique patients. Among patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression (n = 21,123), we measured rates of psychiatrist visits, readmissions, and visits to the emergency department within 30 and 180 days after discharge.\nRESULTS: Psychiatrist supply varied from 7.2 per 100 000 residents in LHINs with below-average supply to 62.7 per 100 000 in the Toronto Central LHIN. Population-based outpatient and inpatient visit rates and psychiatric admission rates increased with LHIN psychiatrist supply. However, as the supply of psychiatrists increased, outpatient panel size for full-time psychiatrists decreased, with Toronto psychiatrists having 58% smaller outpatient panels and seeing 57% fewer new outpatients relative to LHINs with the lowest psychiatrist supply.

Diagnostic data abstracted from the records of 281 randomly selected psychiatric patients from 2 hospitals in Toronto were linked to the administrative data cohort to test sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values.\n\nResults:\nUsing only hospitalization data to capture chronic psychotic illness yielded the highest specificity (range 69.9% to 84.7%) and the highest PPV (range 55.2% to 80.8%). Using physician service claims in addition to hospitalization data to capture cases increased sensitivity (range 90.1% to 98.8%) but decreased specificity (range 31.1% to 68.0%) and PPV (range 38.4% to 71.1%).\n\nConclusion:\nUsing health administrative data to study population-based outcomes for people with chronic psychotic illness is feasible and valid.

  {"id":"kurdyak2017b","abstract":"Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in demographic, geographic, and practice characteristics of all Ontario psychiatrists between 2003 and 2013 and their implication for access to psychiatrists.\nMethods: We included all psychiatrists who were clinically active in Ontario in any year from 2003 to 2013. For each psychiatrist, we reported age, sex, years since medical school graduation, geographic practice region, and practice characteristics such as total number of inpatients, outpatients, and outpatient visit frequencies.\nResults: In 2013, there were 2070 psychiatrists, with nearly half (47%) more than 30 years since medical school graduation. Female psychiatrists comprised 41% of all psychiatrists in 2013 but 56% of all psychiatrists within 15 years of medical school graduation. Between 2003 and 2013, there was a 17% increase in the total number of psychiatrists, with the largest growth in psychiatrists occurring in the group more than 30 years from medical school graduation. Over these 11 years, the mean (SD) number of unique outpatients seen by a psychiatrist annually increased from 208 (228) to 249 (275) (19.5%; P = 0.001), with male psychiatrists, on average, seeing more outpatients annually than female psychiatrists.\nConclusion: The number of outpatients seen by psychiatrists is slowly increasing. However, the large proportion of aging psychiatrists, the high concentration of psychiatrists in urban settings, and the increase in the number of female psychiatrists with smaller practices suggest that without radical changes to the way psychiatrists practice, access to psychiatrists will remain a challenge in Ontario.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kurdyak","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Zaheer","given":"Juveria"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Joyce"},{"family":"Rudoler","given":"David"},{"family":"Mulsant","given":"Benoit H."}],"citation-key":"kurdyak2017b","container-title":"The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Can J Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1177/0706743716661325","ISSN":"0706-7437","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"40-47","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Changes in Characteristics and Practice Patterns of Ontario Psychiatrists: Implications for Access to Psychiatrists","title-short":"Changes in Characteristics and Practice Patterns of Ontario Psychiatrists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743716661325","volume":"62"},

The Toronto Site is part of an unblinded multi-site randomized pragmatic trial of HF for homeless adults with mental illness in Canada, which followed participants up to 7 years. Five hundred seventy-five participants were recruited and classified as having high (HN) or moderate need (MN) for mental health support services. Each group was randomized into intervention (HF) and treatment as usual groups, and 567 (98.6%) consented to link their data to health administrative databases. HF participants received a monthly rent supplement of $600 (Canadian) and assertive community treatment (ACT) support or intensive care management (ICM) support based on need level. Treatment as usual (TAU) participants had access to social, housing, and health services generally available in the community. Outcomes included all-cause and mental health-specific hospitalization, number of days in hospital, and ED visit. We used GEE models to estimate ratio of rate ratios (RRR). The results showed HF with ACT had no significant effect on hospitalization rates among HN participants, but reduced the number of days in hospital (RRR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.63) and number of ED visits (RRR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.95).

  {"id":"lamb2001","abstract":"The authors discuss what can be learned from our experience with deinstitutionalization. The deinstitutionalization of mentally ill persons has three components: the release of these individuals from hospitals into the community, their diversion from hospital admission, and the development of alternative community services. The greatest problems have been in creating adequate and accessible community resources. Where community services have been available and comprehensive, most persons with severe mental illness have significantly benefited. On the other hand, there have been unintended consequences of deinstitutionalization—a new generation of uninstitutionalized persons who have severe mental illness, who are homeless, or who have been criminalized and who present significant challenges to service systems. Among the lessons learned from deinstitutionalization are that successful deinstitutionalization involves more than simply changing the locus of care; that service planning must be tailored to the needs of each individual; that hospital care must be available for those who need it; that services must be culturally relevant; that severely mentally ill persons must be involved in their service planning; that service systems must not be restricted by preconceived ideology; and that continuity of care must be achieved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lamb","given":"H.

  {"id":"lambri2012","abstract":"Objectives. Deinstitutionalization of long-term psychiatric patients produced various community-based residential care facilities. However, inner-city areas have many patients with severe mental illness (SMI) as well as deprivation, unemployment, and crime. This makes meeting their community needs complex. We undertook a needs assessment of service provision and consonance between service users' evaluation of need and by care workers. Design. Cross-sectional study with random sample of SMI service users in four housing settings: rehabilitation units; high-supported; medium-supported; low-supported housing. Setting. London Borough of Haringey. Outcome Measures. 110 SMI service users and 110 keyworkers were interviewed, using Camberwell Assessment of Need; SF-36; Lancashire Quality-of-Life profile; demographic and clinical information. Results. People in “low-support” and “high-support” housing had similar symptom scores, though low support had significantly lower quality of life. Quality of life was positively predicted by self-reported mental-health score and negatively predicted by unmet-need score in whole sample and in medium-support residents. Residents' and care-workers' assessments of need differed considerably. Conclusions. Although patients' housing needs were broadly met, those in low-supported housing fared least well. Attendance to self-reported mental health and unmet social needs to quality of life underpins planning of residential services for those with SMI. Social and personal needs of people in supported housing may be underestimated and overlooked; service providers need to prioritise these if concept of “recovery” is to advance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lambri","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Chakraborty","given":"Apu"},{"family":"Leavey","given":"Gerard"},{"family":"King","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"lambri2012","container-title":"The Scientific World Journal","container-title-short":"ScientificWorldJournal","DOI":"10.1100/2012/836067","ISSN":"2356-6140","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,19]]},"page":"836067","PMCID":"PMC3506896","PMID":"23213300","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Quality of Life and Unmet Need in People with Psychosis in the London Borough of Haringey, UK","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3506896/","volume":"2012"},

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Housing First with ACT and treatment as usual.\n\nMethods:\n\nBetween October 2009 and June 2011, a total of 950 homeless individuals with serious mental illness were recruited in five Canadian cities: Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Moncton. Participants were randomly assigned to Housing First (N=469) or treatment as usual (N=481) and followed up for up to 24 months. The intervention consisted of scattered-site Housing First, using rent supplements, with ACT. The treatment-as-usual group had access to all other services. The perspective of society was adopted for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Days of stable housing served as the outcome measure. Retrospective questionnaires captured service use data.\n\nResults:\n\nMost (69%) of the costs of the intervention were offset by savings in other costs, such as emergency shelters, reducing the net annual cost of the intervention to about Can$6,311 per person. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was Can$41.73 per day of stable housing (95% confidence interval=Can$1.96–$83.70).

We tracked primary care contacts and\ncontinuity, hospital admissions (total, via the emergency department and\nfor targeted conditions), and cost of physician services, hospital care\nand pharmaceuticals, for 24 months before and 24 months after the\nintervention. RESULTS: Of 155 754 eligible patients, 63.7% had at least 1\nincentive payment billed.

  {"id":"lavergne2019f","abstract":"Introduction Canadians report persistent problems accessing primary care despite an increasing per-capita supply of primary care physicians (PCPs). There is speculation that PCPs, especially those early in their careers, may now be working less and/or choosing to practice in focused clinical areas rather than comprehensive family medicine, but little evidence to support or refute this. The goal of this study is to inform primary care planning by: (1) identifying values and preferences shaping the practice intentions and choices of family medicine residents and early career PCPs, (2) comparing practice patterns of early-career and established PCPs to determine if changes over time reflect cohort effects (attributes unique to the most recent cohort of PCPs) or period effects (changes over time across all PCPs) and (3) integrating findings to understand the dynamics among practice intentions, practice choices and practice patterns and to identify policy implications.\nMethods and analysis We plan a mixed-methods study in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia. We will conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews with family medicine residents and early-career PCPs and analyse survey data collected by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. We will also analyse linked administrative health data within each province. Mixed methods integration both within the study and as an end-of-study step will inform how practice intentions, choices and patterns are interrelated and inform policy recommendations.\nEthics and dissemination This study was approved by the Simon Fraser University Research Ethics Board with harmonised approval from partner institutions. This study will produce a framework to understand practice choices, new measures for comparing practice patterns across jurisdictions and information necessary for planners to ensure adequate provider supply and patient access to primary care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lavergne","given":"M.

  {"id":"lavergne2022","abstract":"Objectives Information on emergency department (ED) visits for mental and substance use disorders (MSUDs) is important for planning services but has not been explored in British Columbia (BC), Canada. We describe all MSUD ED visits for people ages 15 and older in the province of BC in 2017/2018 and document trends in MSUD ED visits between 2007/2008 and 2017/2018 by disorder group.\nDesign Population-based linked administrative data comprised of ED records and physician billings capturing all MSUD ED visits in BC.\nSetting BC is Canada’s westernmost province with a population of approximately 5 million. Permanent residents receive first-dollar coverage for all medically necessary services provided by licensed physicians or in hospitals, including ED services.\nPopulation All people age >15 with MSUD ED visits during the study period.\nMeasures All claims with a service location in the ED or corresponding to fee items billed only in the ED were examined alongside ED visits reported through a national reporting system. Patient characteristics (sex/gender, age, location of residence, income, treated disorders and comorbidities) and previous outpatient service use for all ED visits by visit diagnosis are also described.\nResults A total of 72 363 people made 134 063 visits to the ED in 2017/2018 for needs related to MSUD. MSUD ED visits have increased since 2010, particularly visits for substance use and anxiety disorders. People with more frequent visits were more likely to be male, on public prescription drug plans for income assistance, prescribed psychiatric medications, and living in lower-income neighbourhoods. They used more community-based primary care and psychiatry services and had lower continuity of primary care.\nConclusions MSUD ED visits are substantial and growing in BC. Findings underscore a need to strengthen and target community healthcare services and adequately resource and support EDs to manage growing patient populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lavergne","given":"M.

Data Sources/Study Setting Nationally representative data from the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey. Study Design Cross-sectional analyses were limited to adults (n = 2,683). We compared sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, access to health care, and utilization of services among homeless and nonhomeless patients. We also examined the independent effect of homelessness on health care access and utilization, as well as factors that influenced homeless patients' health care experiences. Data Collection Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted with health center patients. Principal Findings Homeless patients had worse health status—lifetime burden of chronic conditions, mental health problems, and substance use problems—compared with housed respondents. In adjusted analyses, homeless patients had twice the odds as housed patients of having unmet medical care needs in the past year (OR = 1.98, 95 percent CI: 1.24–3.16) and twice the odds of having an ED visit in the past year (OR = 2.00, 95 percent CI: 1.37–2.92).

The sample consisted of 106 hospitals from which 45,497 adults with serious mental illness were discharged in 2006. Guided by the extended version of Andersen's health care utilization model, hierarchical linear modeling, including patient case mix, hospital, and regional characteristics, was used to explain variations in hospitalization length.\n\nResults:\n\nThe average length of stay was 10.0±3.0 days. Stays were longer at psychiatric hospitals than at general acute care facilities and at hospitals with a greater percentage of Medicare patients and patients with serious mental illness and a higher rate of readmission. In terms of regional characteristics, stays were also longer at hospitals in counties where the county mental health program received a larger percentage of the state's mental health budget and a smaller share of the budget was used for residential care.\n\nConclusions:\n\nHospital type and case mix, along with the presence of housing resources funded by county mental health programs, were found to be associated with variations in length of hospitalization. Further research of a longitudinal or prospective nature is required to determine whether the availability of housing programs for persons with mental disorders leads to shorter hospital stays for those in crisis and to determine whether longer stays are the result of differences in hospital practices.

  {"id":"lee2020a","abstract":"We investigated whether associations between area deprivation, urbanicity and elevated risk of severe mental illnesses (SMIs, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) is accounted for by social drift or social causation. We extracted primary and secondary care electronic health records from 2004 to 2015 from a population of 3.9 million. We identified prevalent and incident individuals with SMIs and their level of deprivation and urbanicity using the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) and urban/rural indicator. The presence of social drift was determined by whether odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regression is greater than the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from Poisson regression. Additionally, we performed longitudinal analysis to measure the proportion of change in deprivation level and rural/urban residence 10 years after an incident diagnosis of SMI and compared it to the general population using standardised rate ratios (SRRs). Prevalence and incidence of SMIs were significantly associated with deprivation and urbanicity (all ORs and IRRs significantly >1). ORs and IRRs were similar across all conditions and cohorts (ranging from 1.1 to 1.4). Results from the longitudinal analysis showed individuals with SMIs are more likely to move compared to the general population. However, they did not preferentially move to more deprived or urban areas. There was little evidence of downward social drift over a 10-year period. These findings have implications for the allocation of resources, service configuration and access to services in deprived communities, as well as, for broader public health interventions addressing poverty, and social and environmental contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Sze Chim"},{"family":"DelPozo-Banos","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Walters","given":"James T.

  {"id":"lee2023","abstract":"Background Despite increasing support for stakeholder inclusion in research, there is limited evaluative research to guide safe (i.e., youth-friendly) and meaningful (i.e., non-tokenistic) partnerships with young people with lived experience of mental ill-health in research. This paper describes a pilot evaluation and iterative design of a Youth Lived Experience Working Group (LEWG) protocol that was established by the Youth Mental Health and Technology team at The University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre, based on the results of two studies. Methods Study one consisted of a pilot evaluation of the extent to which youth partners felt empowered to contribute, to qualitatively explore how LEWG processes could be improved. Youth partners completed online surveys, and results were shared over two LEWG meetings in 2021 to empower youth partners to collectively identify actions of positive change regarding LEWG processes. These meetings were audio-recorded and transcripts were subsequently coded using thematic analysis. Study two assessed whether LEWG processes and proposed improvements were acceptable and feasible from the perspective of academic researchers via an online survey in 2022. Results Quantitative and qualitative data collected from nine youth partners and 42 academic researchers uncovered initial learnings regarding facilitators, motivators, and barriers to partnering with young people with lived experience in research. Implementing clear processes for youth partners and academic researchers on effective partnership strategies, providing training opportunities for youth partners to develop research skills, and providing regular updates on how youth partner contributions led to research outcomes were identified as key facilitators. Conclusions This pilot study provides insight into a growing international field on how to optimise participatory processes so that researchers and young people with lived experience can be better supported and engaged to make meaningful contributions to mental health research. We argue that more transparency is needed around participatory research processes so that partnerships with young people with lived experience are not merely tokenistic. Consumer Contributions Our study has also been approved by and reflects the concepts and priorities of our youth lived experience partners and lived experience researchers, all of whom are authors of this paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Grace Yeeun"},{"family":"McKenna","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yun Ju C."},{"family":"Hutcheon","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Hockey","given":"Samuel J."},{"family":"Laidler","given":"Rachael"},{"family":"Occhipinti","given":"Jo-An"},{"family":"Perry","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Lindsay-Smith","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Ramsay","given":"Annabel"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Skye"},{"family":"Feirer","given":"Dakota"},{"family":"Shim","given":"Andrew W."},{"family":"Cottle","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Anith"},{"family":"New","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Elizabeth Mary"},{"family":"Freebairn","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Hickie","given":"Ian Bernard"}],"citation-key":"lee2023","container-title":"Health Expectations","DOI":"10.1111/hex.13777","ISSN":"1369-7625","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

  {"id":"li2022b","abstract":"Digital, self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions circumvent many barriers to in-person therapy for young people (aged 12-24 years), although adherence to these interventions is low. The absence or insufficient disclosure of recommendations or instructions for appropriate use may account for this. As such, many young people may not self-administer these interventions appropriately or receive the optimal degree of treatment.This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on digital CBT for depression and anxiety in young people to describe how appropriate use has been defined and communicated to users as instructions for use, to describe how adherence has been measured, and to determine the associations between adherence and treatment outcomes.A systematic review was conducted with 2 reviewers (SHL and MRA) extracting data independently. Overall, 4 electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched in April 2021 for studies that met the following inclusion criteria: participants aged between 12 and 24 years, evaluated a digital CBT intervention targeting depression or anxiety, and reported instructions or recommendations for use or measures of adherence. Studies that evaluated non-CBT interventions or cognitive- or behavioral-only interventions were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs.There were 32 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (88%) were unique studies (N=16,578 youths). Definitions of appropriate use varied among the different interventions in terms of intended recipients, duration and frequency of use, and the features used to support engagement and adherence to appropriate use definitions. Reporting of appropriate use definitions in studies was inconsistent, with no study systematically describing components of appropriate use or providing information on how recommendations for use were relayed to users. Most often, definitions of appropriate use were derived from the study protocol and descriptions of intervention features. Adherence was mostly operationalized as the degree of intervention completion; however, reporting of adherence data was heterogeneous. There was little evidence of an association between degree of use and outcomes in the 9 studies that examined this.Definitions of appropriate use are unique to each digital CBT intervention. However, statements of appropriate use are not systematically reported in the literature. Furthermore, the extent to which recommendations for use are communicated to users is not routinely reported. Despite unique definitions of appropriate use, adherence was most often generically operationalized as the degree of intervention completion and was not consistently associated with outcomes. We proposed a framework to promote systematic reporting of definitions of appropriate use for digital interventions to provide guidance to users and to assist the development of appropriate and nuanced measures of adherence.PROSPERO CRD42020208668; https://tinyurl.com/4bu2yram.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Sophie H."},{"family":"Achilles","given":"Melinda Rose"},{"family":"Werner-Seidler","given":"Aliza"},{"family":"Beames","given":"Joanne R"},{"family":"Subotic-Kerry","given":"Mirjana"},{"family":"O'Dea","given":"Bridianne"}],"citation-key":"li2022b","container-title":"JMIR mental health","DOI":"10.2196/37640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,28]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4282962959","title":"Appropriate use and operationalisation of adherence to digital cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety in youth: A systematic review.

  {"id":"lim2018","abstract":"Background\nA rapid increase of Medicaid expenditures has been a serious concern, and housing stability has been discussed as a means to reduce Medicaid costs. A program evaluation of a New York City supportive housing program has assessed the association between supportive housing tenancy and Medicaid savings among New York City housing program applicants with serious mental illness and chronic homelessness or dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance use disorder, stratified by distinctive Medicaid expenditure patterns.\n\nMethods\nThe evaluation used matched data from administrative records for 2827 people. Sequence analysis identified 6 Medicaid expenditure patterns during 2 years prior to baseline among people placed in the program (n = 737) and people eligible but not placed (n = 2090), including very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditure, low, middle, high, and very high Medicaid expenditure patterns. We assessed the impact of the program on Medicaid costs for 2 years post-baseline via propensity score matching and bootstrapping.\n\nResults\nThe housing program was associated with Medicaid savings during 2 years post-baseline (−$9526, 95% CI = −$19,038 to -$2003). Stratified by Medicaid expenditure patterns, Medicaid savings were found among those with very low Medicaid coverage (−$15,694, 95% CI = −$35,926 to -$7983), increasing Medicaid expenditures (−$9020, 95% CI = −$26,753 to -$1705), and high Medicaid expenditure patterns (−$14,450, 95% CI = −$38,232 to -$4454). Savings were largely driven by shorter psychiatric hospitalizations in the post-baseline period among those placed.\n\nConclusions\nThe supportive housing program was associated with Medicaid savings, particularly for individuals with very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditures, and high Medicaid expenditures pre-baseline.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12913-017-2816-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lim","given":"Sungwoo"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Stazesky","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Tejinder P."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Tiffany G."},{"family":"Levanon Seligson","given":"Amber"}],"citation-key":"lim2018","container-title":"BMC Health Services Research","container-title-short":"BMC Health Serv Res","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-017-2816-9","ISSN":"1472-6963","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,10]]},"page":"15","PMCID":"PMC5761184","PMID":"29316920","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Impact of a New York City supportive housing program on Medicaid expenditure patterns among people with serious mental illness and chronic homelessness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5761184/","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"lin2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pay-for-performance is a financial incentive\nwhich links physicians' income to the quality of their services. Although\nPay-for-performance(P4P) is suggested to be an effective payment method in\nmany pilot countries (i.e. the United Kingdom) and enjoys a wide\napplication in primary health care, researches on it are yet to reach an\nagreement. Thus a systematic review was conducted on the evidence of\nimpact of P4P on behavior of primary care physicians and patient outcomes\naiming to provide a comprehensive and objective evaluation of P4P for\ndecision makers. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed,\nEMbase and The Cochrane Library. Electronic search was conducted in the\nfourth week of January, 2013. As the included studies had significant\nclinical heterogeneity, a descriptive analysis was conducted. Quality\nIndex was adopted for quality assessment of evidences. RESULTS: Database\nsearches yielded 651 candidate articles, of which 44 studies fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria. An overall positive effect was found on the management\nof disease, which varied in accordance with the baseline medical quality\nand the practice size. Meanwhile, it could bring about new problems\nregarding the inequity, patients' dissatisfaction and increasing medical\ncost.

  {"id":"lingard2021","abstract":"Many researchers dread writing. They find it laborious - even painful - to put their scholarly work into words. They get bogged down in the study, and lose track of the story. And they produce uninspiring papers that fail to resonate with readers or reviewers. This book offers an antidote to this problem: brief, accessible lessons that guide researchers to write clear and compelling scientific manuscripts. The book is divided into three sections: Story, Craft, and Community. The Story section offers advice on getting the balance of study and story just right, introducing strategies for tackling each section of a scientific manuscript. The Craft section considers the grammatical and rhetorical tools of the trade, showing how they can be wielded for maximum impact. And the Community section offers suggestions for writing collaboratively, supporting other writers, and navigating peer review. Each section features multiple short and pragmatic lessons, peppered with illustrative examples. Readers can use the chapters collectively to build holistic writing skills, or dip in and out to refine specific elements of the craft. Rooted in a coaching philosophy, we aim to unlock our readers' potential as writers through instruction, reflection, and example. And we hope to inspire researchers to face writing with joy. This work is clearly written and easily understandable. Its many practical examples, tools, and exercises make an effective toolbox of support for scholarly writers. This will be invaluable to new scholars and help established scholars as well. The inclusion of examples specific to the health arena and the clear, elegantly simple explanations add strength and relevance to this work.

Information was collected by national researchers who reviewed relevant literature and policy documents to report on the establishment and evolution of patient registration, the requirements and benefits for patients, providers and payers, and its connection to primary care reforms.\nResults\nPatient registration emerged as part of major macro-level health reforms linked to the introduction of universal health coverage. Recent reforms introduced registration with the aim of improving quality through better coordination and efficiency through reductions in unnecessary referrals. Patient registration is mandatory only in three countries. Several countries achieve high levels of registration by using strong incentives for patients and physicians (capitation payments).\nConclusion\nPatient registration means different things in different countries and policy-makers and researchers need to take into consideration: the history and characteristics of the registration system; the use of incentives for patients and providers; and the potential for more explicit use of patient-provider agreements as a policy to achieve more timely, appropriate, continuous and integrated care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Marchildon","given":"Gregory P."},{"family":"Brammli-Greenberg","given":"Shuli"},{"family":"Dayan","given":"Mark"},{"family":"De Belvis","given":"Antonio Giulio"},{"family":"Gandré","given":"Coralie"},{"family":"Isaksson","given":"David"},{"family":"Kroneman","given":"Madelon"},{"family":"Neuhner-Jehle","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Saunes","given":"Ingrid Sperre"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Vrangbæk","given":"Karsten"},{"family":"Quentin","given":"Wilm"}],"citation-key":"marchildon2021","container-title":"Health Policy","container-title-short":"Health Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.09.001","ISSN":"0168-8510","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,6]]},"language":"en","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Achieving higher performing primary care through patient registration: A review of twelve high-income countries","title-short":"Achieving higher performing primary care through patient registration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851021002232"},

  {"id":"mark2018","abstract":"Objective:\n\nGiven low psychiatrist participation in insurance networks, this study examines how psychiatrists are reimbursed in network and out of network under commercial insurance relative to other providers for the same diagnoses and services.\n\nMethods:\n\nPaid private insurance claims from the 2014 Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database were analyzed. The sample included all services billed for 3.8 million individuals with a mental disorder as the primary diagnosis by psychiatrists, nonpsychiatrist medical doctors, psychologists, social workers, or psychiatric nurses. The authors determined the most common services provided by each provider type, the median reimbursement and median out-of-pocket payment for the services by provider type and by network status (in or out of network), and the proportion of bills for services delivered out of network.\n\nResults:\n\n“Evaluation and management” services for presenting problems of low to moderate and moderate to high severity were the two procedures most frequently billed by psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrist medical doctors. The median reimbursement for services for presenting problems of low to moderate and moderate to high severity was 13% less ($66 versus $76) and 20% less ($91 versus $114), respectively, for psychiatrists versus nonpsychiatrist medical doctors if the services were provided in network but 28% higher ($100 versus $78) and 6% higher ($122 versus $115), respectively, for psychiatrists versus nonpsychiatrist medical doctors for services provided out of network.\n\nConclusions:\n\nPsychiatrists receive lower in-network reimbursement than nonpsychiatrist medical doctors for many of the same services. This may contribute to psychiatrists’ lower participation in insurance networks relative to other providers and has implications for patient cost sharing and access to psychiatrists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mark","given":"Tami L."},{"family":"Olesiuk","given":"William"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Mir M."},{"family":"Sherman","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"Mutter","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Teich","given":"Judith L."}],"citation-key":"mark2018","container-title":"Psychiatric Services","container-title-short":"PS","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201700271","ISSN":"1075-2730","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3]]},"page":"281-285","publisher":"American Psychiatric Publishing","source":"ps.psychiatryonline.org (Atypon)","title":"Differential Reimbursement of Psychiatric Services by Psychiatrists and Other Medical Providers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201700271","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"masoud2021","abstract":"Abstract\n          \n            Background\n            The inclusion of stakeholders throughout the research process has been gaining recognition as an approach that can improve the quality and impact of research. Stakeholder engagement for dementia care research has been identified as a national priority, though evaluation of engagement strategies and their impact has been limited. In dementia care research, stakeholders can include individuals living with dementia, family care partners, and health and social care professionals in dementia care. A Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) was established to identify priorities for dementia care research that are most important to stakeholders. Strategies to build capacity for research and facilitate engagement among the SAC were used to identify the research priorities. This study describes the experiences of SAC members engaged in the research process.\n            Methods\n            To evaluate stakeholder engagement, semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of the SAC to understand their experiences and perspectives on the strategies used to facilitate engagement and build capacity for research. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Findings were presented to members of the SAC to determine whether they felt their perspectives and experiences were accurately represented. Final domains and themes presented here were approved by the SAC.\n            Results\n            Interviews (N=11) were conducted with members of the SAC representing each stakeholder group; persons living with dementia (n=2); family care partners (n=4), and health and social care professionals in dementia care (n=5). Ten themes were categorized into four overarching domains: accessibility, council infrastructure, values and environment, and benefits of involvement.\n            Conclusions\n            Findings from this qualitative study are a resource for researchers seeking to collaborate with diverse stakeholder groups to represent their perspectives in research, including individuals living with dementia. The domains and themes identified here support the inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the research process, centering engagement and capacity building strategies around individuals living with dementia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Masoud","given":"Sara Suzanne"},{"family":"Glassner","given":"Ashlie A."},{"family":"Patel","given":"Neela"},{"family":"Mendoza","given":"Mayra"},{"family":"James","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Rivette","given":"Sheran"},{"family":"White","given":"Carole L."}],"citation-key":"masoud2021","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-300254/v1","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,24]]},"publisher":"In Review","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Engagement with a Diverse Stakeholder Advisory Council for Research in Dementia Care","type":"report","URL":"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-300254/v1"},
  {"id":"masters2014","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Criteria for psychiatric hospitalization have undergone marked changes. Efforts to limit length-of-hospitalization risk greater morbidity at discharge and increased needs for appropriate aftercare. Accordingly, we evaluated factors associated with length of psychiatric hospitalization and aftercare-types.\nMETHODS: We reviewed medical records of 589 patients with major psychiatric disorders hospitalized in a university-affiliated, not-for-profit psychiatric hospital to identify characteristics associated with length of hospitalization, types of aftercare and insurance coverage, using standard bivariate and multivariate analytical methods.\nRESULTS: Notable factors associated with longer hospitalization included: more highly supervised aftercare, diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective>affective disorders, longer illnesses, higher antipsychotic doses and more complex drug-treatments at discharge, lower GAF functional status, unemployment, being unmarried, as well as public vs. private insurance. Multivariate modeling sustained association of longer hospitalization with higher antipsychotic doses, more structured aftercare, public insurance, lower GAF scores, and diagnoses of chronic psychotic disorders. Structured aftercare was associated with younger age, fewer years ill, and private insurance, but varied little by diagnosis and was unrelated to ethnicity. Public insurance was associated notably with being unemployed, unmarried, less functional, having a chronic psychotic disorder for more years, and lack of structured aftercare.\nCONCLUSIONS: Illness severity and functional impairment may modulate efforts to limit psychiatric hospitalization. Higher-level aftercare was associated with illness and disability factors as well as with private insurance; public insurance was associated with dysfunction, unemployment and chronic illness, as well as longer hospitalization.","author":[{"family":"Masters","given":"Grace A."},{"family":"Baldessarini","given":"Ross J."},{"family":"Öngür","given":"Dost"},{"family":"Centorrino","given":"Franca"}],"citation-key":"masters2014","container-title":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Compr Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.11.004","ISSN":"1532-8384","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"681-687","PMID":"24387922","source":"PubMed","title":"Factors associated with length of psychiatric hospitalization","type":"article-journal","volume":"55"},

Bisher gibt es nur wenig Forschung, wie effektiv kognitive Verhaltenstherapie (KVT) bei dieser Patientengruppe ist. Ziel der Studie war es daher, die Effektivität von KVT in einem naturalistischen Setting bei erwerbstätigen und arbeitslosen Patienten zu vergleichen.\n\n  Methode Es wurden 92 ambulante Patienten mit häufigen psychischen Störungen (depressive Störungen und Angststörungen) post-hoc gematcht und zum Prä-, Post- und Katamnese-Messzeitpunkt untersucht.\n\n  Ergebnisse Arbeitslose Patienten waren zu allen Messzeitpunkten psychisch stärker belastet. Eine Multi-Level-Analyse ergab, dass beide Gruppen gleichermaßen von KVT profitieren. In beiden Gruppen wurden mittlere bis hohe Effektstärken gefunden. Zum Zeitpunkt der Katamnese wurde ein Drittel der erwerbstätigen und ein Fünftel der arbeitslosen Patienten als unbeeinträchtigt klassifiziert. Die berufliche Integrationsquote der Arbeitslosen betrug 26%.\n\n  Diskussion Die Effektstärken sprechen dafür, dass KVT effektiv in beiden Gruppen ist. Die arbeitslosen Patienten waren zum Therapieende allerdings genauso beeinträchtigt wie die erwerbstätigen Patienten zu Beginn der Therapie. Die gefundene berufliche Integrationsquote war vergleichbar mit der allgemeinen Integrationsquote in Deutschland, obwohl keine expliziten arbeitsplatzbezogenen Interventionen durchgeführt wurden. \n\n  Schlussfolgerung KVT ist bei arbeitslosen Patienten effektiv.

Adults with severe mental illness who were at high risk for homelessness (n = 121; 72.7% schizophrenia spectrum) were assigned randomly to integrated or parallel housing services and followed for 18 months. Integrated housing services led to more days of stable housing and greater life satisfaction than parallel housing services, especially for male participants.

  {"id":"mercuri2013","abstract":"Rationale, aims and objectives Allocating resources on the basis of population need is a health care policy goal in many countries. Thus, resources must be allocated in accordance with need if stakeholders are to achieve policy goals. Small area methods have been presented as a means for revealing important information that can assist stakeholders in meeting policy goals. The purpose of this review is to examine the extent to which small area methods provide information relevant to meeting the goals of a needs-based health care policy. Methods We present a conceptual framework explaining the terms ‘demand’, ‘need’, ‘use’ and ‘supply’, as commonly used in the literature. We critically review the literature on small area methods through the lens of this framework. Results ‘Use’ cannot be used as a proxy or surrogate of ‘need’. Thus, if the goal of health care policy is to provide equal access for equal need, then traditional small area methods are inadequate because they measure small area variations in use of services in different populations, independent of the levels of need in those populations. Conclusions Small area methods can be modified by incorporating direct measures of relative population need from population health surveys or by adjusting population size for levels of health risks in populations such as the prevalence of smoking and low birth weight. This might improve what can be learned from studies employing small area methods if they are to inform needs-based health care policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mercuri","given":"Mathew"},{"family":"Birch","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Gafni","given":"Amiram"}],"citation-key":"mercuri2013","container-title":"Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","DOI":"10.1111/jep.12026","ISSN":"1365-2753","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"1054-1059","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Using small-area variations to inform health care service planning: what do we ‘need’ to know?","title-short":"Using small-area variations to inform health care service planning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jep.12026","volume":"19"},

Barriers pertain mainly to costs, not knowing where to get help, excessive wait times, and insufficient funding. Through the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities agreement, action is being taken by all jurisdictions in Canada to increase community-based mental health promotion programs and early interventions, especially those targeting children and youth. A growing body of evidence is demonstrating how specific community and primary care-based interventions are both effective and cost-effective. These integrated community solutions, shown to be effective for increasing access to appropriate services for patients while saving costs to the healthcare system, would benefit from the recent funding investments put in place by the federal government.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Moroz","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Moroz","given":"Isabella"},{"family":"D’Angelo","given":"Monika Slovinec"}],"citation-key":"moroz2020a","container-title":"Healthcare Management Forum","container-title-short":"Healthc Manage Forum","DOI":"10.1177/0840470420933911","ISSN":"0840-4704, 2352-3883","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","page":"282-287","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mental health services in Canada: Barriers and cost-effective solutions to increase access","title-short":"Mental health services in Canada","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0840470420933911","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"morton2022","abstract":"BackgroundGender is routinely pitched as a key determinant of vulnerability for staff and residents on acute mental health inpatient units. Since the 1960's mixed gender units have become more prominent in Western health systems, yet questions remain around the configuration of these units, including how to ensure emotional and physical safety of those living and working in them.MethodsThis paper draws on a large study of the lived experiences of 42 staff and 43 service users from different acute mental health units in New Zealand. We conducted thematic analysis of interview data from four units with diverse architectural layouts to identify key themes central to decisions around gender and spatial design.ResultsKey themes emerged around gender-related trauma histories, safety perceptions and vulnerabilities, accommodation of gender-diverse and non-binary mental health service users, and gender-specific needs and differences. A further theme, of it goes beyond gender emphasized that there are many other non-gender attributes that influence vulnerability on the unit.ConclusionsWhile findings emphasize the need for safe places for vulnerable people, trauma-informed care, access to staff who “understand,” and recreation that is meaningful to the individual, we question if the dilemma of gender-separation vs. gender-mixing is an outmoded design consideration. Instead, we argue that a flexible, person-centered approach to provision of care, which values autonomy, privacy, and safety as defined by each service user, and that promotes choice-making, obviates a model where gender accommodations are fore. We found that a gender-exclusive narrative of vulnerability understates the role of other identifiers in dynamics of risk and vulnerability, including age, physicality, past violence, trauma history, mental unwellness, and substance use. We conclude gender need not be a central factor in decisions around design of prospective built unit environments or in occupational and clinical decisions. Instead, we suggest flexible spatial layouts that accommodate multiple vulnerabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Morton","given":"Elizabeth Kathleen"},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"Sarah K."},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Every-Palmer","given":"Susanna"},{"family":"Jenkin","given":"Gabrielle Lisa Simone"}],"citation-key":"morton2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Gender and intersecting vulnerabilities on the mental health unit: Rethinking the dilemma","title-short":"Gender and intersecting vulnerabilities on the mental health unit","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.940130","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"mueller2014","abstract":"Taking notes on laptops rather than in longhand is increasingly common. Many researchers have suggested that laptop note taking is less effective than longhand note taking for learning. Prior studies have primarily focused on students' capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers' tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.","author":[{"family":"Mueller","given":"Pam"},{"family":"Oppenheimer","given":"Daniel M."}],"citation-key":"mueller2014","container-title":"Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1177/0956797614524581","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,23]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2095632701","page":"1159-1168","PMID":"24760141","title":"The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"muijen1992","abstract":"OBJECTIVE--To compare the efficacy of home based care with standard hospital care in treating serious mental illness. DESIGN--Randomised controlled trial. SETTING--South Southwark, London. PATIENTS--189 patients aged 18-64 living in catchment area. 92 were randomised to home based care (daily living programme) and 97 to standard hospital care. At three months' follow up 68 home care and 60 hospital patients were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Use of hospital beds, psychiatric diagnosis, social functioning, patients' and relatives' satisfaction, and activity of daily living programme staff. RESULTS--Home care reduced hospital stay by 80% (median stay six days in home care group, 53 days in hospital group) and did not increase the number of admissions compared with hospital care. On clinical and social outcome there was a non-significant trend in favour of home care, but both groups showed big improvements. On the global adjustment scale home care patients improved by 26.8 points and the hospital group by 21.6 points (difference 5.2; 95% confidence interval -1.5 to 12). Other rating scales showed similar trends. Home care patients required a wide range of support in areas such as housing, finance, and work. Only three patients dropped out from the programme. CONCLUSIONS--Home based care may offer some slight advantages over hospital based care for patients with serious mental illness and their relatives. The care is intensive, but the low drop out rate suggests appreciation. Changes to traditional training for mental health workers are required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Muijen","given":"M."},{"family":"Marks","given":"I."},{"family":"Connolly","given":"J."},{"family":"Audini","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"muijen1992","container-title":"BMJ : British Medical Journal","container-title-short":"BMJ","ISSN":"0959-8138","issue":"6829","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",3,21]]},"page":"749-754","PMCID":"PMC1881624","PMID":"1571681","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Home based care and standard hospital care for patients with severe mental illness: a randomised controlled trial.","title-short":"Home based care and standard hospital care for patients with severe mental illness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1881624/","volume":"304"},

A medical records review was conducted to quantify housing-related delay and housing difficulties noted. Perceptions of discharge staff about the factors contributing to the delays were gathered through in-depth interviews and analysed using constant comparative analysis. Findings indicated that HRDD for working aged adults accounted for 11.6% of total mental health bed days in 2018, costing the health system \\4,054,149. When extrapolated nationally HRDD could cost Australia \\269.5 million per year. While individual characteristics and contexts were thought to make some patients more vulnerable, data indicated that the major contributors were lack of housing options, lack of services, difficulty with funding and lack of clear pathways to achieve housing.

However, the evidence for this pattern of change comes from investigations of short-term treatments and it is unclear whether this also holds for more flexible and long-term psychotherapy. We provided open-ended treatments under routine-care conditions for a representative sample of 362 patients, including a large proportion characterized by severe psychopathology. Patients attended 52 sessions on average (SD = 59, range = 1-364, Mdn = 36). Our results indicated that the degree of improvement was linearly associated with time spent in psychotherapy and contingent upon the severity of psychological problems at intake. The least severely afflicted received the shortest treatments, experienced the most rapid change but demonstrated smaller overall magnitudes of improvement. More severely suffering patients received longer treatments, had slower rates of change but in general received greater overall benefits. We argue that previous suggestions of psychotherapy dosage have been less appropriate for patients suffering from moderate to severe psychopathology.","author":[{"family":"Nordmo","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Monsen","given":"Jon T."},{"family":"Høglend","given":"Per"},{"family":"Solbakken","given":"Ole André"}],"citation-key":"nordmo2020","container-title":"Psychotherapy Research","DOI":"10.1080/10503307.2020.1861359","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3112371058","page":"859-869","title":"Investigating the dose–response effect in open-ended psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},

We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Obermeyer","given":"Ziad"},{"family":"Powers","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Vogeli","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Mullainathan","given":"Sendhil"}],"citation-key":"obermeyer2019","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aax2342","issue":"6464","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,25]]},"page":"447-453","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342","volume":"366"},
  {"id":"ocampo2009","abstract":"Consultations with community-based service providers in Toronto identified a lack of strong research evidence about successful community-based interventions that address the needs of homeless clients experiencing concurrent mental health and substance use disorders. We undertook a collaborative research effort between academic-based and community-based partners to conduct a systematic evidence synthesis drawing heavily from Pawson’s realist review methodology to focus on both whether programs are successful and why and how they lead to improved outcomes. We examined scholarly and nonscholarly literature to explore program approaches and program elements that lead to improvements in mental health and substance use disorders among homeless individuals with concurrent disorders (CD). Information related to program contexts, elements, and successes and failures were extracted and further supplemented by key informant interviews and author communication regarding reviewed published studies. From the ten programs that we reviewed, we identified six important and promising program strategies that reduce mental health and, to a far lesser degree, substance use problems: client choice in treatment decision-making, positive interpersonal relationships between client and provider, assertive community treatment approaches, providing supportive housing, providing supports for instrumental needs, and nonrestrictive program approaches. These promising program strategies function, in part, by promoting and supporting autonomy among homeless adults experiencing CD. Our realist informed review is a useful methodology for synthesizing complex programming information on community-based interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Campo","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Kirst","given":"Maritt"},{"family":"Schaefer-McDaniel","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Firestone","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Allison"},{"family":"McShane","given":"Kelly"}],"citation-key":"ocampo2009","container-title":"Journal of Urban Health : Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine","container-title-short":"J Urban Health","DOI":"10.1007/s11524-009-9392-1","ISSN":"1099-3460","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11]]},"page":"965-989","PMCID":"PMC2791817","PMID":"19760155","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Community-Based Services for Homeless Adults Experiencing Concurrent Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders: A Realist Approach to Synthesizing Evidence","title-short":"Community-Based Services for Homeless Adults Experiencing Concurrent Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791817/","volume":"86"},

  {"id":"paris2015","abstract":"Our paper offers a perspective on barriers to access to psychiatric care. Research shows that access depends not simply on the total number of trained specialists but also on their kind of practice. In some large cities, some practitioners follow a small number of patients in long-term psychotherapy, a practice supported by government insurance, which places no limits on the number of sessions or treatment duration. The problem is that long-term psychotherapy, despite a rich tradition in psychiatry, is not an evidence-based treatment. This review recommends a model in which psychiatrists spend more time in consultation with primary care professionals, in acute care for patients with severe mental illness, and in briefer, more cost-effective forms of psychotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Paris","given":"Joel"},{"literal":"David S.

  {"id":"parys2016","abstract":"Despite the significant responsibility that physicians have in healthcare delivery, we know surprisingly little about why physician practice styles vary within or across institutions. Estimating variation in physician practice styles is complicated by the fact that patients are rarely randomly assigned to physicians. This paper uses the quasi-random assignment of patients to physicians in emergency departments (EDs) to show how physicians vary in their treatment of patients with minor injuries. The results reveal a considerable degree of variation in practice styles within EDs; physicians at the 75th percentile of the spending distribution spend 20% more than physicians at the 25th percentile. Observable physician characteristics do not explain much of the variation across physicians, but there is a significant degree of sorting between physicians and EDs over time, with high-cost physicians sorting into high-cost EDs as they gain experience. The results may shed light on why some EDs remain persistently higher-cost than others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Parys","given":"Jessica Van"}],"citation-key":"parys2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0159882","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,12]]},"language":"en","page":"e0159882","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Variation in Physician Practice Styles within and across Emergency Departments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159882","volume":"11"},

We used validated questionnaires to assess occupational, psychosocial and medical data in a multicenter transverse study. Univariate analysis on chi² test was performed with stratification according to job (nurse, nursing assistant), and variables found to be significant on each dimension were included on multivariate models. 1428 nursing assistants and 342 registered nurses were included. 391 nursing assistants and 85 registered nurses intended to leave their work with the elderly. The registered nurses’ intention to leave was associated with deteriorated care-team or residents relations, and with perceived elevated hardship due to the proximity of residents’ death. The nursing assistants’ intention to leave was associated with deteriorated management relation, with job insecurity and elevated hardship due to the residents’ intellectual deterioration. Impaired physical or psychological health status also correlated with this intention.

Method: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 tenants with SMI living in supported housing. Results: Choice while living in supported housing was a large contributor to wellbeing and mental health recovery. Tenants valued three domains of choice: (1) choosing to be responsible for one’s life, (2) choosing how to organize one’s social life and (3) choices that make them feel “at home”.

Socio-demographic and enabling characteristics, severity of symptoms, disability, (under treatment for) chronic somatic conditions, perceived need for care, beliefs and evaluations of care were measured by questionnaires. Actual care data were derived from electronic medical records. Criteria for guideline-concordant care were based on general practice guidelines, issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners.\n\nResults\nTwo hundred and eighty-one (39%) patients received guideline-concordant care. High education level, accessibility of care, comorbidity of anxiety and depression, and severity and disability scores were positively associated with receiving guideline-concordant care in univariate analyses. In multivariate multi-level logistic regression models, significant associations with the clinical need factors disappeared. Positive evaluations of accessibility of care increased the chance (OR = 1.31; 95%−CI = 1.05–1.65; p = 0.02) of receiving guideline-concordant care, as well as perceiving any need for medication (OR = 2.99; 95%−CI = 1.84–4.85; p < 0.001), counseling (OR = 2.25; 95%−CI = 1.29–3.95; p = 0.005) or a referral (OR = 1.83; 95%−CI = 1.09–3.09; p = 0.02).

The health and long-term care systems in the United States rely heavily on the services of registered nurses, but concerns exist about the adequacy of the current and projected supply of registered nurses to meet the nation's needs. One way to increase the nursing supply is to increase the retention rates of nurses, especially men nurses who are much more likely to leave nursing than are women. The study hypothesizes that the different retention rates of men and women can be explained in part by their different gender roles and careers goals.\n\n\n\nMETHODS. A secondary analysis was conducted of the registered nurses who left nursing for other occupations in the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, 2000.\n\n\n\nFINDINGS. Three reasons for leaving nursing were cited most often by the male and female nurses who left nursing: better salaries available in current type of position, hours more convenient in other position, and find current position more rewarding professionally. Results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis show that men were 2.5 times more likely than women to cite better salaries as a reason for leaving the nursing profession, but no more likely to cite more convenient hours or to state that the non-nursing position was more professionally more rewarding.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS.

  {"id":"raven2020","abstract":"Objective To examine whether randomization to permanent supportive housing (PSH) versus usual care reduces the use of acute health care and other services among chronically homeless high users of county-funded services. Data Sources Between 2015 and 2019, we assessed service use from Santa Clara County, CA, administrative claims data for all county-funded health care, jail and shelter, and mortality. Study Design We conducted a randomized controlled trial among chronically homeless high users of multiple systems. We compared postrandomization outcomes from county-funded systems using multivariate regression analysis. Data Collection We extracted encounter data from an integrated database capturing health care at county-funded facilities, shelter and jails, county housing placement, and death certificates. Principal Findings We enrolled 423 participants (199 intervention; 224 control). Eighty-six percent of those randomized to PSH received housing compared with 36 percent in usual care. On average, the 169 individuals housed by the PSH intervention have remained housed for 28.8 months (92.9 percent of the study follow-up period). Intervention group members had lower rates of psychiatric ED visits IRR 0.62; 95% CI [0.43, 0.91] and shelter days IRR 0.30; 95% CI [0.17, 0.53], and higher rates of ambulatory mental health services use IRR 1.84; 95% CI [1.43, 2.37] compared to controls. We found no differences in total ED or inpatient use, or jail. Seventy (37 treatment; 33 control) participants died. Conclusions The intervention placed and retained frequent user, chronically homeless individuals in housing. It decreased psychiatric ED visits and shelter use, and increased outpatient mental health care, but not medical ED visits or hospitalizations. Limitations included more than one-third of usual care participants received another form of subsidized housing, potentially biasing results to the null, and loss of power due to high death rates. PSH can house high-risk individuals and reduce emergent psychiatric services and shelter use. Reductions in hospitalizations may be more difficult to realize.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Raven","given":"Maria C."},{"family":"Niedzwiecki","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Kushel","given":"Margot"}],"citation-key":"raven2020","container-title":"Health Services Research","DOI":"10.1111/1475-6773.13553","ISSN":"1475-6773","issue":"S2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 The Authors.

  {"id":"reid2022","abstract":"Background and objective\n\nHistorically, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) research has been conducted on individuals with lived experience rather than with them. This article draws on feedback from workshops with individuals with lived experience, in which a collaborative approach was followed, drawing on patient-oriented and participatory action research methods. We provide an overview of the feedback, including barriers to participation alongside strategies to address these barriers, facilitating meaningful involvement in the research process. The writing team includes those with lived experience and research backgrounds. In addition, we make a distinction between the experience of those with FASD (what is called “in-body lived experience”) and those that have caregiver experience (what is called “in-home lived experience”). By lowering barriers, the goal is to bring in the many different perspectives of those with lived experience.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nA keynote presentation and two workshops were held in 2018 at an international FASD conference bringing together individuals, families, agencies, and researchers. Participants were asked what they required to participate in FASD research more thoroughly. The goal was to understand barriers to participating in FASD research. In the first workshop (n=65), imagined for general conference participants including caregivers, service providers, policymakers, and researchers but primarily attended by caregivers and service providers, participants were asked to rank barriers through a “dotmocracy” process. Dotmocracy (or dot-voting) is a collaborative prioritization technique commonly used in group facilitation. A tally of the number of dots assigned to each barrier by participants was used to rank the importance of the barriers identified. Small groups discussed strategies to address the top 10 barriers. In the second workshop, composed of adolescents and adults with FASD (n=60), the participants were asked to share the obstacles they faced in research as a collaborator or as a research participant and their suggestions for future research area priorities.\n\nResults\n\nParticipants in the first workshop noted core concerns, including the need for financial support, barriers to informed participation, unconscious bias of researchers, lack of a common language, lack of time and support to participate, absence of shared leadership in the research, perceived absence of benefits for participants, lack of accommodation for the unique needs of individuals with lived experience, scarcity of resources to accommodate those needs and insufficient communication on current FASD research projects. The information from individuals with FASD was similar and focused on the unique needs and barriers to fully participating in FASD research either as a collaborator or research participant. For example, participants identified the need for researchers to accommodate language comprehension differences, memory issues, anxiety, and sensory issues experienced by individuals with FASD. In addition, they identified barriers to participation such as finances, lack of transportation, insecure housing, and childcare demands. Finally, participants noted that FASD is a spectrum disorder and people on all ends of the spectrum need to have a voice.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe workshops provided a wealth of information regarding research areas on which to focus, unique needs and barriers to participation, and their need to have a voice. Research that is attentive to each of these groups’ unique needs will allow for the inclusion of the widest group of individuals that identify as having lived experience relative to FASD. As a result, patient-oriented and participatory action research can be better represented in the field of FASD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Reid","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Brownstone","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Schofield","given":"Niall"},{"family":"Pitawanakwat","given":"Robyn"}],"citation-key":"reid2022","container-title":"Journal of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder","DOI":"10.22374/jfasd.v4iSP1.14","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,21]]},"page":"e20-e35","publisher":"University of Toronto Press","source":"utpjournals.press (Atypon)","title":"Nothing About Us Without Us","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.22374/jfasd.v4iSP1.14","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"richards2011a","abstract":"Introduction\nWorldwide, health systems are improving access to empirically supported psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. Evaluations of this effort are limited by the cross sectional nature of studies, short implementation periods, poor data completeness rates and lack of clinically significant and reliable change metrics.\nObjective\nAssess the impact of implementing stepped care empirically supported psychological therapies by measuring the prospective outcomes of patients referred over a two year period to one Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service in the UK.\nMethod\nWe collected demographic, therapeutic and outcome data on depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) from 7859 consecutive patients for 24months between 1st July 2006 and 31st August 2008, following up these patients for a further one year.\nResults\n4183 patients (53%) received two or more treatment sessions. Uncontrolled effect size for depression was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.29) and for anxiety was 1.04 (0.88 to 1.23). 55.4% of treated patients met reliable improvement or reliable and clinically significant change criteria for depression, 54.7% for anxiety. Patients received a mean of 5.5 sessions over 3.5h, mainly low-intensity CBT and phone based case management. Attrition was high with 47% of referrals either not attending for an assessment or receiving an assessment only.\nConclusions\nRecovery rates for patients receiving stepped care empirically supported treatments for anxiety and depression in routine practice are 40 to 46%. Only half of all patients referred go on to receive treatment. Further work is needed to improve routine engagement of patients with anxiety and depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Richards","given":"David A."},{"family":"Borglin","given":"Gunilla"}],"citation-key":"richards2011a","container-title":"Journal of Affective Disorders","container-title-short":"Journal of Affective Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.024","ISSN":"0165-0327","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9,1]]},"page":"51-60","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Implementation of psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in routine practice: Two year prospective cohort study","title-short":"Implementation of psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in routine practice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032711001078","volume":"133"},

Agency theory and the economic principles of performance‐based compensation are applied in the context of imperfect information, risk aversion, multiple interrelated tasks, and team production efficiencies. Fee‐for‐service and capitation are flawed methods of motivating physicians to achieve specific goals. Payment innovations that blend elements of fee‐for‐service, capitation, and case rates can preserve the advantages and attenuate the disadvantages of each. These innovations include capitation with fee‐for‐service carve‐outs, department budgets with individual fee‐for‐service or “contact” capitation, and case rates for defined episodes of illness. The context within which payment incentives are embedded, includes such nonprice mechanisms as screening and monitoring and such organizational relationships as employment and ownership. The analysis has implications for health services research and public policy with respect to physician payment incentives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"James C."}],"citation-key":"robinson2001","container-title":"The Milbank Quarterly","container-title-short":"Milbank Quarterly","DOI":"10.1111/1468-0009.00202","ISSN":"0887-378X, 1468-0009","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",6]]},"language":"en","page":"149-177","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Theory and Practice in the Design of Physician Payment Incentives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.00202","volume":"79"},

Delayed discharge was associated with mortality, infections, depression, reductions in patients’ mobility and their daily activities. The qualitative studies highlighted the pressure to reduce discharge delays on staff stress and interprofessional relationships, with implications for patient care and well‐being.

  {"id":"rosenheck1997","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Clients' and providers' perceptions of clients' needs were compared in 18 community treatment programs participating in the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports program of the Center for Mental Health Services, a national demonstration project on treatment of homeless persons with mental illness. The study sought to determine whether perceptions differed and whether assessed needs for services were related to service use. METHODS: A total of 1,482 clients contacted through community outreach who entered the case management phase of the program after an average of 32 days were given an evaluation interview at entry into the program. The clients and outreach workers identified clients' needs in seven core domains-mental health, general health, substance abuse, public financial support, housing assistance and support, dental care, and employment. Use of related services in the 60 days before the case management evaluation was determined. RESULTS: The greatest differences between clients' and providers' perceptions of service needs were in dental and medical services, which were more frequently identified as needs by clients, and in substance abuse and mental health services, which were more frequently identified by providers. Clients' and providers' assessments of need were significantly, but not strongly, correlated with each other, and both were correlated with use of mental health and substance abuse services. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health service providers are less likely than clients to identify needs for services other than mental health services. Service use, at least in the short run, is related to both clients' and providers' assessments of need.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenheck","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ann","given":"Julie"}],"citation-key":"rosenheck1997","container-title":"Psychiatric Services","container-title-short":"PS","DOI":"10.1176/ps.48.3.381","ISSN":"1075-2730","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",3]]},"page":"381-386","publisher":"American Psychiatric Publishing","source":"ps.psychiatryonline.org (Atypon)","title":"Homeless mentally ill clients' and providers' perceptions of service needs and clients' use of services","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ps.48.3.381","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"rudoler2017a","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In September 2011, the government of Ontario implemented payment incentives to encourage the delivery of community-based psychiatric care to patients after discharge from a psychiatric hospital admission and to those with a recent suicide attempt. We evaluated whether these incentives affected supply of psychiatric services and access to care.\nMETHODS: We used administrative data to capture monthly observations for all psychiatrists who practised in Ontario between September 2009 and August 2014. We conducted interrupted time-series analyses of psychiatrist-level and patient-level data to evaluate whether the incentives affected the quantity of eligible outpatient services delivered and the likelihood of receiving follow-up care.\nRESULTS: Among 1921 psychiatrists evaluated, implementation of the incentive payments was not associated with increased provision of follow-up visits after discharge from a psychiatric hospital admission (mean change in visits per month per psychiatrist 0.0099, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.0989 to 0.1206; change in trend 0.0032, 95% CI −0.0035 to 0.0095) or after a suicide attempt (mean change −0.0910, 95% CI −0.1885 to 0.0026; change in trend 0.0102, 95% CI 0.0045 to 0.0159). There was also no change in the probability that patients received follow-up care after discharge (change in level −0.0079, 95% CI −0.0223 to 0.0061; change in trend 0.0007, 95% CI −0.0003 to 0.0016) or after a suicide attempt (change in level 0.0074, 95% CI −0.0094 to 0.0366; change in trend 0.0006, 95% CI −0.0007 to 0.0022).\nINTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that implementation of the incentives did not increase access to follow-up care for patients after discharge from a psychiatric hospital admission or after a suicide attempt, and the incentives had no effect on supply of psychiatric services. Further research to guide design and implementation of more effective incentives is warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rudoler","given":"David"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Claire","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Joyce"},{"family":"Kurdyak","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"rudoler2017a","container-title":"CMAJ","DOI":"10.1503/cmaj.160816","ISSN":"0820-3946, 1488-2329","issue":"49","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,11]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 Joule Inc. or its licensors","page":"E1509-E1516","PMID":"29229712","publisher":"CMAJ","section":"Research","source":"www.cmaj.ca","title":"Payment incentives for community-based psychiatric care in Ontario, Canada","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/189/49/E1509","volume":"189"},

The role of recent physician graduates in this problem of supply of primary care services has not been established. We sought to establish whether career stage or graduation cohort were related to family physician practice volume and continuity of care over time.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of family physician practice from 1997/98 to 2017/18. We collected administrative health and physician claims data in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia. We included all physicians who registered with their respective provincial regulatory colleges as having a medical specialty of family practice or who had billed the provincial health insurance system for patient care as family physicians, or both. We used regression models to isolate the effects of 3-year categories of years in practice (at all career stages), time period and cohort on patient contacts and physician-level continuity of care.\nResults: Between 1997/98 and 2017/18, the median number of patient contacts per provider per year fell by between 515 and 1736 contacts in the 4 provinces examined. Median contacts peaked at 27–29 years in practice in all provinces, and median physician-level continuity of care increased until 30 or more years in practice. We found no association between graduation cohort and patient contacts or physician-level continuity of care.\nInterpretation: Recent cohorts of family physicians practise similarly to their predecessors in terms of practice volumes and continuity of care.

  {"id":"rudoler2023","abstract":"Introduction The Canadian population has poor and inequitable access to psychiatric care despite a steady per-capita supply of psychiatrists in most provinces. There is some quantitative evidence that practice style and characteristics vary substantially among psychiatrists. However, how this compares across jurisdictions and implications for workforce planning require further study. A qualitative exploration of psychiatrists’ preferences for practice style and the practice choices that result is also lacking. The goal of this study is to inform psychiatrist workforce planning to improve access to psychiatric care by: (1) developing and evaluating comparable indicators of supply of psychiatric care across provinces, (2) analysing variations and changes in the characteristics of the psychiatrist workforce, including demographics and practice style and (3) studying psychiatrist practice choices and intentions, and the factors that lead to these choices.\nMethods and analysis A cross-provincial mixed-methods study will be conducted in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia. We will analyse linked-health administrative data within three of the four provinces to develop comparable indicators of supply and characterise psychiatric services at the regional level within provinces. We will use latent profile analysis to estimate the probability that a psychiatrist is in a particular practice style and map the geographical distribution of psychiatrist practices overlayed with measures of need for psychiatric care. We will also conduct in-depth, semistructured qualitative interviews with psychiatrists in each province to explore their preferences and practice choices and to inform workforce planning.\nEthics and dissemination This study was approved by Ontario Tech University Research Ethics Board (16637 and 16795) and institutions affiliated with the study team. We built a team comprising experienced researchers, psychiatrists, medical educators and policymakers in mental health services and workforce planning to disseminate knowledge that will support effective human resource policies to improve access to psychiatric care in Canada.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rudoler","given":"David"},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"M.

  {"id":"ryan2016","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Introduced in 2004, the UK's Quality and Outcomes Framework\n(QOF) is the world's largest primary care pay-for-performance programme.\nWe tested whether the QOF was associated with reduced population\nmortality. METHODS: We used population-level mortality statistics between\n1994 and 2010 for the UK and other high-income countries that were not\nexposed to pay-for-performance. The primary outcome was age-adjusted and\nsex-adjusted mortality per 100 000 people for a composite outcome of\nchronic disorders that were targeted by the QOF. Secondary outcomes were\nage-adjusted and sex-adjusted mortality for ischaemic heart disease,\ncancer, and a composite of all non-targeted conditions. For each study\noutcome, we created a so-called synthetic UK as a weighted combination of\ncomparison countries. We then estimated difference-in-differences models\nto test whether mortality fell more in the UK than in the synthetic UK\nafter the QOF. FINDINGS: Introduction of the QOF was not significantly\nassociated with changes in population mortality for the composite outcome\n(-3·68 per 100 000 population [95% CI -8·16 to 0·80]; p=0·107), ischaemic\nheart disease (-2·21 per 100 000 [-6·86 to 2·44]; p=0·357), cancer (0·28\nper 100 000 [-0·99 to 1·55]; p=0·679), or all non-targeted conditions\n(11·60 per 100 000 [-3·91 to 27·11]; p=0·143). INTERPRETATION: Although we\nnoted small mortality reductions for a composite outcome of targeted\ndisorders, the QOF was not associated with significant changes in\nmortality. Our findings have implications for the probable effects of\nsimilar programmes on population health outcomes.

Participants were 407 social worker–referred homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses (89% of referrals) from September 2003 until May 2006, with follow-up through December 2007. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.Housing offered as transitional housing after hospitalization discharge, followed by placement in long-term housing; case management offered on-site at primary study sites, transitional housing, and stable housing sites. Usual care participants received standard discharge planning from hospital social workers.Hospitalizations, hospital days, and emergency department visits measured using electronic surveillance, medical records, and interviews. Models were adjusted for baseline differences in demographics, insurance status, prior hospitalization or emergency department visit, human immunodeficiency virus infection, current use of alcohol or other drugs, mental health symptoms, and other factors.The analytic sample (n = 405 [n = 201 for the intervention group, n = 204 for the usual care group]) was 78% men and 78% African American, with a median duration of homelessness of 30 months.

  {"id":"schultz2017a","abstract":"Background: Given the changing landscape of primary care, there may be fewer primary care physicians available to provide a broad range of services to patients of all age groups and health conditions. We sought to identify physicians with comprehensive primary care practices in Ontario using administrative data, investigating how many and what proportion of primary care physicians provided comprehensive primary care and how this changed over time.\nMethods: We identified the pool of active primary care physicians in linked population-based databases for Ontario from 1992/93 to 2014/15. After excluding those who saw patients fewer than 44 days per year, we identified physicians as providing comprehensive care if more than half of their services were for core primary care and if these services fell into at least 7 of 22 activity areas. Physicians with 50% or less of their services for core primary care but with more than 50% in a single location or type of service were identified as being in focused practice.\nResults: In 2014/15, there were 12 891 physicians in the primary care pool: 1254 (9.7%) worked fewer than 44 days per year, 1619 (12.6%) were in focused practice, and 1009 (7.8%) could not be classified. The proportion in comprehensive practice ranged from 67.5% to 74.9% between 1992/93 and 2014/15, with a peak in 2002/03 and relative stability from 2009/10 to 2014/15. Over this period, there was an increase of 8.8% in population per comprehensive primary care physician.\nInterpretation: We found that just over two-thirds of primary care physicians provided comprehensive care in 2014/15, which indicates that traditional estimates of the primary care physician workforce may be too high.

  {"id":"scott2011a","abstract":"Background: The use of blended payment schemes in primary care, including\nthe use of financial incentives to directly reward 'performance' and\n'quality' is increasing in a number of countries. There are many examples\nin the US, and the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) for general\npractitioners (GPs) in the UK is an example of a major system-wide reform.\nDespite the popularity of these schemes, there is currently little\nrigorous evidence of their success in improving the quality of primary\nhealth care, or of whether such an approach is cost-effective relative to\nother ways to improve the quality of care. Objectives: The aim of this\nreview is to examine the effect of changes in themethod and level of\npayment on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians (PCPs)\nand to identify: i) the different types of financial incentives that have\nimproved quality; ii) the characteristics of patient populations for whom\nquality of care has been improved by financial incentives; and iii) the\ncharacteristics of PCPs who have responded to financial incentives. Search\nStrategy: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of\nCare (EPOC) Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled\nTrials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (The\nCochrane Library),MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychLIT, and\nECONLIT. Searches of Internet-based economics and health economics working\npaper collections were also conducted. Finally, studies were identified\nthrough the reference lists of retrieved articles, websites of key\norganisations, and from direct contact with key authors in the field.\nArticles were included if they were published from 2000 to August 2009.\nSelection Criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before\nand after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS)\nevaluating the impact of different financial interventions on the quality\nof care delivered by primary healthcare physicians (PCPs). Quality of care\nwas defined as patient reported outcome measures, clinical behaviours, and\nintermediate clinical and physiological measures. Data Collection and\nAnalysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed\nstudy quality, in consultation with two other review authors where there\nwas disagreement. For each included study, we reported the estimated\neffect sizes and confidence intervals. Main Results: Seven studies were\nincluded in this review. Three of the studies evaluated single-threshold\ntarget payments, one examined a fixed fee per patient achieving a\nspecified outcome, one study evaluated payments based on the relative\nranking of medical groups' performance (tournament-based pay), one study\nexamined amix of tournament-based pay and threshold payments, and one\nstudy evaluated changing from a blended payments scheme to salaried\npayment. Three cluster RCTs examined smoking cessation; one CBA examined\npatients' assessment of the quality of care; one CBA examined cervical\nscreening, mammography screening, and HbA1c; one ITS focused on four\noutcomes in diabetes; and one controlled ITS (a difference-in-difference\ndesign) examined cervical screening, mammography screening, HbA1c,\nchildhood immunisation, chlamydia screening, and appropriate asthma\nmedication. Six of the seven studies showed positive but modest effects on\nquality of care for some primary outcome measures, but not all. One study\nfound no effect on quality of care. Poor study design led to substantial\nrisk of bias in most studies. In particular, none of the studies addressed\nissues of selection bias as a result of the ability of primary care\nphysicians to select into or out of the incentive scheme or health plan.\nAuthors' Conclusions: The use of financial incentives to reward PCPs for\nimproving the quality of primary healthcare services is growing. However,\nthere is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of\nfinancial incentives to improve the quality of primary health care.\nImplementation should proceed with caution and incentive schemes should be\nmore carefull designed before implementation. In addition to basing\nincentive design more on theory, there is a large literature discussing\nexperiences with these schemes that can be used to draw out a number of\nlessons that can be learned and that could be used to influence or modify\nthe design of incentive schemes. More rigorous study designs need to be\nused to account for the selection of physicians into incentive schemes.\nThe use of instrumental variable techniques should be considered to assist\nwith the identification of treatment effects in the presence of selection\nbias and other sources of unobserved heterogeneity. In randomised trials,\ncare must be taken in using the correct unit of analysis and more\nattention should be paid to blinding. Studies should also examine the\npotential unintended consequences of incentive schemes by having a\nstronger theoretical basis, including a broader range of outcomes, and\nconducting more extensive subgroup analysis. Studies should more\nconsistently describe i) the type of payment scheme at baseline or in the\ncontrol group, ii) how payments to medical groups were used and\ndistributed within the groups, and iii) the size of the new payments as a\npercentage of total revenue. Further research comparing the relative costs\nand effects of financial incentives with other behaviour change\ninterventions is also required.","author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"A"},{"family":"Sivey","given":"P"},{"family":"Ait Ouakrim","given":"D"},{"family":"Willenberg","given":"L"},{"family":"Naccarella","given":"L"},{"family":"Furler","given":"J"},{"family":"Young","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"scott2011a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"title":"The effect of financial incentives on the quality of health care provided by primary care physicians (review)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www2.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab008451.html"},

We examined whether an intervention by a specially trained pharmacist could reduce the number of daily medication units taken by elderly patients, as well as costs and health care use.\nMethods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in family practices in 24 sites in Ontario. We randomly allocated 48 randomly selected family physicians (69.6% participation rate) to the intervention or the control arm, along with 889 (69.5% participation rate) of their randomly selected community-dwelling, elderly patients who were taking 5 or more medications daily. In the intervention group, pharmacists conducted face-to-face medication reviews with the patients and then gave written recommendations to the physicians to resolve any drug-related problems. Process outcomes included the number of drug-related problems identified among the senior citizens in the intervention arm and the proportion of recommendations implemented by the physicians.\nResults: After 5 months, seniors in the intervention and control groups were taking a mean of 12.4 and 12.2 medication units per day respectively (p = 0.50).

  {"id":"skaburskis2006","abstract":"This paper examines the filtering process and shows the extent of the forces that are gentrifying Canadian cities. The 1996 census micro data are used to develop rent- and price-age profiles of dwellings in each of Canada's census metropolitan areas. The analysis shows that the filtering process is both too slow and, at best, can have too small an effect to be a part of a government strategy for reducing the housing burdens of low-income people. Filtering is not helping lower-income households. The most important finding shows the reversal in the direction of filtering in all Canadian metropolitan areas since 1981. The rents and prices of older dwellings have been rising faster than those of the newer units. The steep 1971 rent- and price-age profiles for Montreal and Toronto are explained to show that government policies would not be able to induce the amount of filtering needed to have a noticeable effect on the welfare of lower-income households. The pressures that eventually find expression in gentrified neighbourhoods are affecting much of the older housing stock. Cities in other countries that are experiencing gentrification may be subject to the same pressures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Skaburskis","given":"Andrejs"}],"citation-key":"skaburskis2006","container-title":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1080/00420980500533612","ISSN":"0042-0980","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"533-558","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Filtering, City Change and the Supply of Low-priced Housing in Canada","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00420980500533612","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"smye2023","abstract":"In this paper, we present ﬁndings from a qualitative study that explored Indigenous people’s experiences of mental health and addictions care in the context of an inner-city area in Western Canada. Using an ethnographic design, a total of 39 clients accessing 5 community-based mental health care agencies were interviewed, including 18 in-depth individual interviews and 4 focus groups. Health care providers also were interviewed (n = 24). Data analysis identiﬁed four intersecting themes: normalization of social suffering; re-creation of trauma; the challenge of reconciling constrained lives with harm reduction; and mitigating suffering through relational practice. The results highlight the complexities of experiences of accessing systems of care for Indigenous people marginalized by poverty and other forms of social inequity, and the potential harms that arise from inattention to the intersecting social context(s) of peoples’ lives. Service delivery that aims to address the mental health concerns of Indigenous people must be designed with awareness of, and responsiveness to, the impact of structural violence and social suffering on peoples’ lived realities. A relational policy and policy lens is key to alleviate patterns of social suffering and counter the harms that are unwittingly created when social suffering is normalized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Smye","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Browne","given":"Annette J."},{"family":"Josewski","given":"Viviane"},{"family":"Keith","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Mussell","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"smye2023","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"IJERPH","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph20043288","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,13]]},"language":"en","page":"3288","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Suffering: Indigenous Peoples’ Experiences of Accessing Mental Health and Substance Use Services","title-short":"Social Suffering","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/4/3288","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"somers2013","abstract":"Background Homelessness and mental illness have a strong association with public disorder and criminality. Experimental evidence indicates that Housing First (HF) increases housing stability and perceived choice among those experiencing chronic homelessness and mental disorders. HF is also associated with lower residential costs than common alternative approaches. Few studies have examined the effect of HF on criminal behavior. Methods Individuals meeting criteria for homelessness and a current mental disorder were randomized to one of three conditions treatment as usual (reference); scattered site HF; and congregate HF. Administrative data concerning justice system events were linked in order to study prior histories of offending and to test the relationship between housing status and offending following randomization for up to two years. Results The majority of the sample (67%) was involved with the justice system, with a mean of 8.07 convictions per person in the ten years prior to recruitment. The most common category of crime was “property offences” (mean = 4.09). Following randomization, the scattered site HF condition was associated with significantly lower numbers of sentences than treatment as usual (Adjusted IRR = 0.29; 95% CI 0.12–0.72). Congregate HF was associated with a marginally significant reduction in sentences compared to treatment as usual (Adjusted IRR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.26–1.14). Conclusions This study is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate benefits of HF among a homeless sample with mental illness in the domain of public safety and crime. Our sample was frequently involved with the justice system, with great personal and societal costs. Further implementation of HF is strongly indicated, particularly in the scattered site format.

Our objective is to determine how equity is incorporated in public primary care policy and strategy documents across Canada. We conducted string term and snowball searches for provincial/territorial primary care policy documents published between 01 January 2018 and 30 June 2022, extracted the policy objective, and applied a rubric to evaluate each document's engagement with equity. We performed content analysis of the documents which acknowledged inequities and articulated a related policy response. Of the 224 identified documents that discussed primary care policy: 63 (28 %) identified one or more structurally marginalized group(s) experiencing inequities related to primary care, 64 (29 %) identified a structurally marginalized group and articulated a policy response, and 16 (7 %) articulated a detailed policy response to address inequities. Even where policy responses were articulated, in most cases these did not directly address the acknowledged inequities. The absence of measurable goals, meaningful community consultation, and tenuous connections between the policy response and inequities mentioned may help explain persistent inequities in primary care across Canada.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Spencer","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Hollingbery","given":"Tai"},{"family":"Bodner","given":"Aidan"},{"family":"Hedden","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"Rudoler","given":"David"},{"family":"Christian","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"M Ruth"}],"citation-key":"spencer2024","container-title":"Health Policy","container-title-short":"Health Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.healthpol.2024.104994","ISSN":"0168-8510","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"page":"104994","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evaluating engagement with equity in Canadian provincial and territorial primary care policies: Results of a jurisdictional scan","title-short":"Evaluating engagement with equity in Canadian provincial and territorial primary care policies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851024000046","volume":"140"},

The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability.

  {"id":"stamenova2022","abstract":"Purpose It is currently unclear how the shift towards virtual care during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may have impacted chronic disease management at a population level. The goals of our study were to provide a description of the levels of use of virtual care services relative to in-person care in patients with chronic disease across Ontario, Canada and to describe levels of healthcare utilization in low versus high virtual care users. Methods We used linked health administrative data to conduct a population-based, repeated cross-sectional study of all ambulatory patient visits in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2018 to January 16, 2021). Further stratifications were also completed to examine patients with COPD, heart failure, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, mental illness, and angina. Patients were classified as low (max 1 virtual care visit) vs. high virtual care users. A time-series analysis was done using interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling on weekly hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and diagnostic tests. Results The use of virtual care increased across all chronic disease patient populations. Virtual care constituted at least half of the total care in all conditions. Both low and high virtual care user groups experienced a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations and laboratory testing at the start of the pandemic. Hospitalization volumes increased again only among the high users, while testing increased in both groups. Outpatient visits among high users remained unaffected by the pandemic but dropped in low users. Conclusion The decrease of in-person care during the pandemic was accompanied by an increase in virtual care, which ultimately allowed patients with chronic disease to return to the same visit rate as they had before the onset of the pandemic. Virtual care was adopted across various chronic conditions, but the relative adoption of virtual care varied by condition with highest rates seen in mental health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Stamenova","given":"Vess"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Cherry"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Jiming"},{"family":"Shakeri","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Cram","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Onil"},{"family":"Bhatia","given":"R.

All 3 models involve rostering of patients and have\nsimilar practice requirements but differ in method of physician\nreimbursement, with the blended capitation models incorporating\nadjustments for age and sex, but not case mix, of rostered patients. We\nevaluated the extent to which persons with mental illness were included in\nphysicians' total practices (as rostered and non-rostered patients) and\nwere included on physicians' rosters across types of medical homes in\nOntario. METHODS: Using population-based administrative data, we\nconsidered 3 groups of patients: those with psychotic or bipolar\ndiagnoses, those with other mental health diagnoses, and those with no\nmental health diagnoses. We modelled the prevalence of mental health\ndiagnoses and the proportion of patients with such diagnoses who were\nrostered across the 3 medical home model types, controlling for\ndemographic characteristics and case mix. RESULTS: Compared with enhanced\nfee-for-service practices, and relative to patients without mental\nillness, the proportions of patients with psychosis or bipolar disorders\nwere not different in blended capitation and team-based blended capitation\npractices (rate ratio [RR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.01;\nRR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.17, respectively).

Rising demand is now exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Transition to ICU from other clinical areas is stressful resulting in significant nurse retention issues. This study therefore aimed to illuminate and explore new nurses' learning experiences in one large intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. METHODOLOGY/METHODS Exploratory qualitative case study utilising two data collection methods: one to one interview with six new ICU nurses and focus groups with six senior/clinical education ICU nurses. SETTING A large major trauma centre in London with over ninety ICU beds. FINDINGS Findings indicate that ICU is a challenging learning environment for new nurses due to the large number of skills which must be developed in a short period of time. Forming supportive social relationships proved important in helping new ICU nurses learn and adapt to this complex clinical environment. The high-risk culture of ICU makes it harder to learn particularly for internationally educated nurses. Frequently changing shift patterns also impacts learning. CONCLUSION Senior ICU nurses should be aware of the issues affecting new nurses and where possible alleviate the stress of working in this challenging environment. They should also consider individual circumstances whilst maintaining high quality education. Social support should be facilitated where possible and new nurses need to be aware of the realities of ICU work.","author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Carolyne"}],"citation-key":"stewart2021c","container-title":"Intensive and Critical Care Nursing","DOI":"10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103094","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,12]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3180099488\nS2ID: f187b45c2de941f8328f3c096dafeda5f22229aa","page":"103094","PMCID":"9759336","PMID":"34266733","title":"Understanding new nurses' learning experiences in intensive care.","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},

METHODS: Ninety-six men with severe mental illness who were entering community housing from a shelter institution were randomized to receive 9 months of a \"critical time\" intervention plus usual services or usual services only. The primary analysis compared the mean number of homeless nights for the two groups during the 18-month follow-up period. To elucidate time trends, survival curves were used. RESULTS: Over the 18-month follow-up period, the average number of homeless nights was 30 for the critical time intervention group and 91 for the usual services group. Survival curves showed that after the 9-month period of active intervention, the difference between the two groups did not diminish.

While there are many publications and reports on clinical variation, few studies are conceptually grounded in a theoretical model. This study describes the empirical foundations of the field and proposes an analytic framework. Method Structured construct mapping of published empirical studies which explicitly address unwarranted clinical variation. Results A total of 190 studies were classified in terms of three key dimensions: perspective (assessing variation across geographical areas or across providers); criteria for assessment (measuring absolute variation against a standard, or relative variation within a comparator group); and object of analysis (using process, structure/resource, or outcome metrics). Conclusion Consideration of the results of the mapping exercise—together with a review of adjustment, explanatory and stratification variables, and the factors associated with residual variation—informed the development of an analytic framework. This framework highlights the role that agency and motivation, evidence and judgement, and personal and organizational capacity play in clinical decision making and reveals key facets that distinguish warranted from unwarranted clinical variation. From a measurement perspective, it underlines the need for careful consideration of attribution, aggregation, models of care, and temporality in any assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Sutherland","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Levesque","given":"Jean-Frederic"}],"citation-key":"sutherland2020","container-title":"Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","DOI":"10.1111/jep.13181","ISSN":"1365-2753","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Authors Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"687-696","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Unwarranted clinical variation in health care: Definitions and proposal of an analytic framework","title-short":"Unwarranted clinical variation in health care","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jep.13181","volume":"26"},

In 2010, the General Practice Rural Incentive Program (GPRIP) was introduced in Australia, causing an exog­ enous change in the eligibility for rural incentives for some geographical areas. This study investigates the effect of this policy reform on waiting times for a non-urgent GP appointment using panel data (2008–2014) on 2058 GPs. Using difference-in-difference methodology, results show that the number of GPs in practices in newly eligible areas increased. However, no evidence is found that this reduces waiting times for existing patients, and only weak evidence is found that waiting times for new patients fell, by around 16%.

  {"id":"thomaspotrebny2022","abstract":"Abstract Background The organizational context in healthcare (i.e., the work environment) is associated with patient outcomes and job satisfaction. Long-term care is often considered to be a challenging work environment, characterized by high job demands, low job control, a fast work pace and job dissatisfaction, which may affect patient care and increase staff turnover.This study aims to investigate the organizational context in nursing homes and the features of favorable or less favorable work environments. Methods This study is a cross-sectional study of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses in Bergen, Norway (n = 1014). The K-means clustering algorithm was used to differentiate between favorable and less favorable work environments, based on the Alberta Context Tool. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between individual sociodemographic factors, nursing home factors and the probability of experiencing a favorable work environment. Results 45% of the sample (n = 453) experienced working in a favorable work environment. Contextual features (especially a supportive work culture, more evaluation mechanisms and greater organizational slack resources) and individual features (having a native language other than Norwegian, working day shifts, working full time and belonging to a younger age group) significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing a favorable work environment. Conclusion The work environment in nursing homes is composed of modifiable contextual features. Action in relation to less favorable features and their associated factors should be a priority for nursing home management. This survey indicates that specific steps can be taken to reduce the reliance on part-time workers and to promote the work environment among staff working the night shift.","author":[{"literal":"Thomas Potrebny"},{"literal":"Jannicke Igland"},{"literal":"Birgitte Espehaug"},{"literal":"Donna Ciliska"},{"literal":"Birgitte Graverholt"}],"citation-key":"thomaspotrebny2022","container-title":"BMC Health Services Research","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-022-08608-9","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,10]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4304097984\nS2ID: 2c5ca29d0d1628386bd80638d2b1995157fc735f","PMCID":"9552400","PMID":"36217149","title":"Individual and organizational features of a favorable work environment in nursing homes: a cross-sectional study","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

However, eliciting the unicity of the individual experience of mental health conditions in the diagnostic process remains challenging. In this position paper, we describe the diagnostic process in psychiatry and outline three challenges for which insights from the design research paradigm, in particular so-called generative sessions, may represent an opportunity for innovation. We suggest that by implementing generative sessions, conversations about individual experience can be initiated, the focus on diagnostic categories can be shifted towards personal variation, and the integration of empirical evidence of recovery can be facilitated. Therefore, we argue that exploring generative sessions in the diagnostic process can stimulate incremental and iterative advancements in diagnostic systems. To test its hypothesized impact on clinical practice, we recommend several directions for further research in co-creation with traditional mental health professionals, people with mental health conditions, and people with lived experience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Veldmeijer","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Terlouw","given":"Gijs"},{"family":"Veer","given":"Job van ‘t"},{"family":"Os","given":"Jim","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Boonstra","given":"Nynke"}],"citation-key":"veldmeijer2023","container-title":"Design for Health","DOI":"10.1080/24735132.2023.2171223","ISSN":"2473-5132","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,28]]},"page":"5-23","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Design for mental health: can design promote human-centred diagnostics?","title-short":"Design for mental health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/24735132.2023.2171223","volume":"7"},

Moderator analyses, justified by effect sizes with significant heterogeneity, demonstrated only three significant moderators referring to the topic covered, the learning objectives, and the duration of the material. Overall, however, the present results suggest that an apparent advantage of longhand notetaking reported in some previous studies can be explained at least partially by distractions from notetaking by other applications that are present only with digital devices.

In this article, we present an in-class data visualization activity intended to expose students to R and R Markdown during the first week of an introductory statistics class.

  {"id":"watson2019","abstract":"Supported housing principles emphasise the importance of decent, stable and affordable housing, and the provision of individualised support to enable people experiencing mental illness to live in their preferred communities, and to recover. This study sought to synthesise qualitative research addressing the question: how does living in supported housing facilitate social connections and participation from the viewpoints of people living with mental illness? Three databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline) were systematically searched to identify 19 peer-reviewed reports on 17 studies published during 2001–2016, in which the views and experiences of supported housing residents with mental illness were reported. Most studies were informed by grounded theory and used interview methods. Appraisal indicated the reports were of varying quality, but all met the inclusion criterion of reporting qualitative data relevant to the research question. Constant comparative methods were used to synthesise the reported data, and to identify themes across the studies. There were four overarching themes regarding the lived experience of supported housing for people with mental illness: (a) living in supported housing gave individuals privacy, a sense of control, stability and security; (b) stable housing supported residents’ confidence to rebuild an identity and meaning in life, (c) there is a delicate balance between appreciating privacy and dealing with loneliness, and (d) opportunities and support to reconnect with families, friends and community are valued. The meta-synthesis findings highlight that supported housing residents face challenges of protecting their privacy and being lonely when on their own. Individualised support approaches need to attend to personal preferences for social participation and their varied meanings and significance. Further research is required to better understand how individualised forms of support can enable supported housing residents to connect with family, friends and community in their preferred ways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Watson","given":"Jasmin"},{"family":"Fossey","given":"Ellie"},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Carol"}],"citation-key":"watson2019","container-title":"Health & Social Care in the Community","DOI":"10.1111/hsc.12615","ISSN":"1365-2524","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"546-564","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A home but how to connect with others?

  {"id":"weber2022","abstract":"Background: Previous research indicates that the physical environment of healthcare facilities plays an important role in the health, well-being, and recovery outcomes of patients. However, prior works on mental healthcare facilities have incorporated physical environment effects from general healthcare settings and patient groups, which cannot be readily transferred to mental healthcare settings or its patients. There appears to be a specific need for evidence synthesis of physical environmental effects in mental healthcare settings by psychopathology.Purpose: This review evaluates the state (in terms of extent, nature and quality) of the current empirical evidence of physical environmental on mental health, well-being, and recovery outcomes in mental healthcare inpatients by psychopathology.Method: A systematic review (PRISMA guidelines) was performed of studies published in English, German, Dutch, Swedish, and Spanish, of all available years until September 2020, searched in Cochrane, Ovid Index, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science and identified through extensive hand-picking. Inclusion criteria were: Adult patients being treated for mental ill-health (common mental health and mood disorders, Cochrane frame); inpatient mental health care facilities; specifications of the physical and socio-physical environment (e.g., design features, ambient conditions, privacy); all types of empirical study designs. Quality assessment and data synthesis were undertaken.Results: The search retrieved 1,068 titles of which 26 met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that there is only indicative evidence of the impact of the physical healthcare environment on patients' mental health, well-being, and recovery outcomes. There is significant lack of pathology-specific evidence. Methodological shortcomings and empirical scarcity account for the poor evidence.Conclusion: This review highlights the need for more research using advanced study designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Monero Flores","given":"Virna"},{"family":"Wheele","given":"Theresa Poppy"},{"family":"Miedema","given":"Elke"},{"family":"White","given":"Emma Victoria"}],"citation-key":"weber2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Patients' Health & Well-Being in Inpatient Mental Health-Care Facilities: A Systematic Review","title-short":"Patients' Health & Well-Being in Inpatient Mental Health-Care Facilities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.758039","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"wennberg1973","abstract":"Health information about total populations is a prerequisite for sound decision-making and planning in the health care field. Experience with a population-based health data system in Vermont reveals that there are wide variations in resource input, utilization of services, and expenditures among neighboring communities. Results show prima facie inequalities in the input of resources that are associated with income transfer from areas of lower expenditure to areas of higher expenditure. Variations in utilization indicate that there is considerable uncertainty about the effectiveness of different levels of aggregate, as well as specific kinds of, health services.\nInformed choices in the public regulation of the health care sector require knowledge of the relation between medical care systems and the population groups being served, and they should take into account the effect of regulation on equality and effectiveness. When population-based data on small areas are available, decisions to expand hospitals, currently based on institutional pressures, can take into account a community's regional ranking in regard to bed input and utilization rates. Proposals by hospitals for unit price increases and the regulation of the actuarial rate of insurance programs can be evaluated in terms of per capita expenditures and income transfer between geographically defined populations. The PSRO's can evaluate the wide variations in level of services among residents of different communities. Coordinated exercise of the authority vested in these regulatory programs may lead to explicit strategies to deal directly with inequality and uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of health care delivery. Population-based health information systems, because they can provide information on the performance of health care systems and regulatory agencies, are an important step in the development of rational public policy for health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wennberg","given":"John"},{"family":"Gittelsohn","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"wennberg1973","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.182.4117.1102","issue":"4117","issued":{"date-parts":[["1973",12,14]]},"page":"1102-1108","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"www-science-org.uproxy.library.dc-uoit.ca (Atypon)","title":"Small Area Variations in Health Care Delivery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.182.4117.1102","volume":"182"},

This review discusses key issues related to outcome measurement, modeling, and implementation of data-informed and measurement-based psychological therapy. First, an overview is provided, covering the rationale of outcome measurement by acknowledging some of the limitations of clinical judgment. Second, different models of outcome measurement are discussed, including pre–post, session-by-session, and higher-resolution intensive outcome assessments. Third, important concepts related to modeling patterns of change are addressed, including early response, dose–response, and nonlinear change. Furthermore, rational and empirical decision tools are discussed as the foundation for measurement-based therapy. Fourth, examples of clinical applications are presented, which show great promise to support the personalization of therapy and to prevent treatment failure. Finally, we build on continuous outcome measurement as the basis for a broader understanding of clinical concepts and data-driven clinical practice in the future.

PS stratification produced the least biased effect estimates. We observed that the impact of sensitivity and specificity on the bias and coverage for each adjustment method is strongly related to prevalence of exposure: as exposure prevalence decreases and/or outcomes are continuous rather than categorical, the effect of misclassification is magnified, producing larger biases and loss of coverage of 95% confidence intervals. PS matching resulted in unpredictably biased effect estimates.\n          Conclusions: \n          The results of this study underline the importance of assessing exposure misclassification in observational studies in the context of PS methods.

Health care costs for the homeless reflect both their medical complexity and psychosocial risk factors. Supportive housing attempts to moderate both by providing stable places to live along with on-site integrated health services. In this pilot study we used a mixture of survey and administrative claims data to evaluate outcomes for formerly homeless people who were living in a supportive housing facility in Oregon between 2010 and 2014. Results from the claims analysis showed significantly lower overall health care expenditures for the people after they moved into supportive housing. Expenditure changes were driven primarily by reductions in emergency and inpatient care. Survey data suggest that the savings were not at the expense of quality: Respondents reported improved access to care, stronger primary care connections, and better subjective health outcomes. Together, these results indicate a potential association between supportive housing and reduced health care costs that warrants deeper consideration as part of ongoing health care reforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Bill J."},{"family":"Vartanian","given":"Keri B."},{"family":"Li","given":"Hsin-Fang"},{"family":"Royal","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Matson","given":"Jennifer K."}],"citation-key":"wright2016","container-title":"Health Affairs","DOI":"10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0393","ISSN":"0278-2715","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"page":"20-27","publisher":"Health Affairs","source":"healthaffairs.org (Atypon)","title":"Formerly Homeless People Had Lower Overall Health Care Expenditures After Moving Into Supportive Housing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0393","volume":"35"},

Understanding the risk factors for suicide at time of diagnosis can aid clinicians in identifying people at risk.\nMethods\nRecords from linked administrative health databases in Ontario, Canada were used to identify individuals aged 16 through 45 years who received a first lifetime diagnosis of SSD (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS)) using a validated algorithm between 01/01/1993 and 12/31/2010. The main outcome was death by suicide following cohort entry until 12/31/2012.\nOutcomes\n75,989 individuals with a first SSD diagnosis (60.1% male, 39.9% female) were followed for an average of 9.56 years. During this period, 1.71% of the total sample (72.1% male, 27.9% female) died by suicide, after an average of 4.32 years.

Psychiatric hospitalizations, mood disorder diagnoses, suicide attempts prior to SSD diagnosis, as well as a later age at first diagnosis, are all predictors of suicide and should be integrated into clinical assessment of suicide risk in this population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zaheer","given":"Juveria"},{"family":"Olfson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Mallia","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Lam","given":"June S.

  {"id":"zhang2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Mixed payment schemes have become one of the effective measures to balance medical costs and quality of medical services. However, altruism as an intrinsic motivation may influence the effect of switching from a pure payment system to mixed payment schemes. This study aimed to quantify physicians’ altruism and analyze the effect of changes of payment system on physicians’ altruism and thus proposed references for the reform of payment system.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We simulated an exogenous payment system in a controlled laboratory with five experimental groups and 150 medical student subjects. Physicians’ altruism was measured by estimating altruistic parameter and marginal rate of substitution. The non-parametric test and the least square regression analysis were used to analyze the differences of altruistic parameters between pure payment systems and mixed payment schemes. Finally, we analyzed the effect of changes in payment system accompanied by changes in trade-off range on physicians’ altruism.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                We find that the mean value of individual altruistic parameter is 0.78 and the marginal rate of substitution is 1.078. Their estimates at the individual level were significantly positively correlated (Spearman’s\n                ρ\n                 = 0.715, p < 0.01). The shift from pure payment system to mixed payment scheme reduced the altruistic parameter. However, the altruistic parameter increased with the increase of the trade-off range. Physicians who were more altruistic generated higher patients’ health benefit. For each unit increase in altruistic parameter, the increase in patients’ health benefit was lower in mixed payment scheme than in the pure payment system.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              The estimates of altruistic parameters are reliable. Physicians attach a higher weight to patients’ benefit than to their own profit. Mixed payment schemes improve physicians’ behavior and relate to lower altruistic parameters; physicians only need to sacrifice less personal profits to generate the same or even higher altruistic parameter as under the pure payment system. The design of mixed payment schemes that make the interests of physicians and patients close to each other by reducing the trade-off range can provide implication for the reform of payment system in which the physicians’ interest and the patients’ benefit are consistent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xinyuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinyan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Han","given":"Youli"}],"citation-key":"zhang2023","container-title":"BMC Health Services Research","container-title-short":"BMC Health Serv Res","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-023-09112-4","ISSN":"1472-6963","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,2]]},"language":"en","page":"111","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Physician altruism under the change from pure payment system to mixed payment schemes: experimental evidence","title-short":"Physician altruism under the change from pure payment system to mixed payment schemes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-023-09112-4","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"zlotnick2013","abstract":"In the 1980s, the combined effects of deinstitutionalization from state mental hospitals and the economic recession increased the number and transformed the demographic profile of people experiencing homelessness in the United States. Specialized health care for the homeless (HCH) services were developed when it became clear that the mainstream health care system could not sufficiently address their health needs. The HCH program has grown consistently during that period; currently, 208 HCH sites are operating, and the program has become embedded in the federal health care system. We reflect on lessons learned from the HCH model and its applicability to the changing landscape of US health care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zlotnick","given":"Cheryl"},{"family":"Zerger","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Phyllis B."}],"citation-key":"zlotnick2013","container-title":"American Journal of Public Health","container-title-short":"Am J Public Health","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2013.301586","ISSN":"0090-0036","issue":"Suppl 2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"page":"S199-S205","PMCID":"PMC3969140","PMID":"24148056","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Health Care for the Homeless: What We Have Learned in the Past 30 Years and What’s Next","title-short":"Health Care for the Homeless","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969140/","volume":"103"},
