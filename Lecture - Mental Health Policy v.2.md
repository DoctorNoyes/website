[Canadian Medicare](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canada-health-care-system.html) includes _medically necessary_ hospital and physician services. This is defined under the _[Canada Health Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-6/)_[.](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-6/) Therefore, physician-delivered mental health care and tertiary mental health care â€” that is mental health care delivered in hospitals â€” is covered by provincial health insurance.

Other mental health services are typically paid for privately, either via charitable and not-for-profit organizations (e.g., Canadian Mental Health Association), out-of-pocket payments, or through private insurance.

Between 2009 and 2017, outpatient mental health visits increase 9%, and psychiatric hospitalizations increase 23%. Two in three outpatient visits for mental health and addictions were provided by family physicians [@mhapresearchteam2021]. 

Emergency department visits for self-harm and suicide increased by 24% between 2009 and 2017. This increase was mostly in young people. Deaths from suicide have remained stable during this time period [@mhapresearchteam2021].  

> Taken together these findings suggest that outpatient mental health and addiction services are insufficient to prevent crises that require emergency services or hospitalization [@mhapresearchteam2021, p.6]. 

## Access to Publicly Funded Mental Health Services

Family physicians and psychiatrists play a significant role in the mental health system, as they provide the majority of publicly funded mental health services in Canada. Individuals who rely on public coverage have limited alternatives for specialized mental health care. Therefore, it is essential to understand the factors that impact the recruitment, retention, and practice patterns of these healthcare professionals for effective mental health human resource planning.

Per capita supply of family physicians and psychiatrists has increased or remained stable in much of Canada. 

![[Pasted image 20240221211848.png|750]]

Yet, access to primary care has declined. In a study using Canadian Community Health Survey Data, we found that the percentage of people with a regular medical provider or place of care declined between 2007/08 and 2017/18 [@lavergne2023]. We also found that inequities in access to care that existed in 2007/08 grew wider for many groups during that same time period. 

![[Pasted image 20240221212015.png|750]]

We know that access to outpatient mental health services is limited, particularly for people in highest need for these services. Health Quality Ontario â€” a provincial agency responsible for health system reporting and quality improvement â€” reported on physician follow-up in the 7 days following a hospitalization for mental illness or addiction. 

![[Pasted image 20240224141809.png|750]]

A study by [@kurdyak2018] found that timely physician follow-up was associated with reduced risk of readmission to hospital for reasons related to mental illness amongst adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 

We also have evidence that the rate of follow-up is lower for more disadvantaged populations. A study found that those who were homeless at discharge were less likely to receive physician follow-up [@laliberte2020a].

And, we know that outcomes tend to be worse the longer people's mental health â€” particularly schizophrenia and psychosis â€” goes untreated. Thus, access to specialized mental health services is critical for these populations. 

To try to encourage follow-up care by psychiatrists, the province introduced a series of payment incentives. The incentives provided bonuses to physicians who say patients 30 days post discharge from a psychiatric hospital, or 180 days post suicide attempt. However, a study in 2017 demonstrated that the incentives were ineffective in increasing access to psychiatric care; <40% of patients received a visit with a psychiatrist in the 180 days following a suicide attempt [@rudoler2017].  

Some have argued that the solution to the problem is more psychiatrists. Certainly, this is one option, but evidence suggests it is unlikely to fully solve the problem. 

First, the demographics of the workforce are changing, with higher proportions of older psychiatrists. This suggests that a new crop of psychiatrists will be needed to simply replace those who are retiring or winding down their practice [@kurdyak2017]. 

Also, a study in 2014 showed that a large proportion of psychiatrists practising in high per-capita supply regions of Ontario tended to see fewer than 100 unique patients per year [@kurdyak2014]. 

![[Pasted image 20240221214056.png|750]]

A follow-up study showed that there were three distinct practice styles for outpatient psychiatrists in Ontario, with one practice style â€” representing about a third of the workforce â€” practising in low volume urban practices and seeing very few new patients [@rudoler2019].  

These studies challenged the idea that increasing per-capita supply alone would solve issues with unmet need for community-based mental health care. Practice patterns also have an important role to play, and understanding the factors that lead to these practice patterns will be important to inform future workforce planning. 

So, physicians are not practicing in the same ways. Given their autonomy to practice how they choose, there is little that policy-makers can do â€” short of changing how they are paid â€” to incentivize changes in psychiatrist practice behaviours. Thus, there is no guarantee that adding additional psychiatrists will dramatically improve access to care, particularly for those most in need. 

Also challenging recruitment is that psychiatrists â€” like family doctors â€” are experiencing burnout. Recruitment of psychiatrists is already challenging. Psychiatrists already treat some of the most complex patient populations and are the lowest (in Ontario) paid medical specialty.

### A Policy Change Was Proposed

Prior to the pandemic, the Ontario government was considering changes to the way psychiatrists and family physicians were compensated for psychotherapies, limiting the number of sessions that patients could access per year. The goal was to increase access to these services for more people. 

The Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) was considering planned cuts to psychotherapy; this was included in negotiations with the Ontario Medical Association.Â The document presented by the MOH limited OHIP funding for 24 hours of psychotherapy per patient per year and estimated it would save the government $13 million annually.Â 

These proposed policy changes generated controversy. The lauded psychiatrist and author, Norman Doidge, was very critical of these proposed changes, saying that it would prevent access to very important mental health therapies for those who currently have access.

However, others had a different view.

The research group that I was a part of at the time released the following statement in response to the policy and the controversy surrounding it.

### What is the Role of Psychiatry in Healthcare Systems?
This whole controversy raises the questions about what the role of psychiatry is within healthcare systems, and whether we have created a healthcare system that promotes this role. 

In preliminary data from qualitative interviews with practising psychiatrists across Canada, we have heard frustrations about their inability to practice in preferred ways.

Participants are suggesting that the existing fee-for-service payment model does not incentivize care for complex patient populations, but does reward ongoing care provided to less complex outpatients â€“ something also reflected in the quantitative results discussed earlier. 

Many psychiatrists we have spoken to report that they would prefer to practice in collaborative mental health care models, which may allow them to better work to their full scopes of practice, while supporting other mental health care providers, including family physicians. Collaborative mental health care models are supported by a large evidence-base.

## So what Does This All Mean?

What we have seen suggests that increasing the size of the physician workforce is needed to support the delivery of mental health services, but that this alone is unlikely to meet growing demands without additional changes.

Physicians are reacting to disincentives to provide comprehensive primary care or community-based psychiatric care for complex patient populations.

Physicians should receive support to practice at their full capacity in order to address the needs of complex patient populations. This includes:
- Support with increasing administrative burden
- Team-based models, including collaborative mental health care models, that are backed by evidence and supported by family physicians and psychiatrists.
- Transition away from pure fee-for-service payment.
- Alternatives to physician-based services are needed for individuals who depend on publicly funded mental health care.
